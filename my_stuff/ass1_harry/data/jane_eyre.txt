AUTHOR’S PREFACE 


A PREFACE to the first edition of “Jane Eyre” being unnecessary, I 
gave none: this second edition demands a few words both of ac- 
knowledgment and miscellaneous remark. 

My thanks are due in three quarters. 

To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain 
tale with few pretensions. 

To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to 
an obscure aspirant. 

To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their prac- 
tical sense, and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and un- 
recommended Author, 

The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, 
and I must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are 
definite: so are certain generous critics who have encouraged me as 
only large-hearted and high-minded men know how to encourage a 
struggling stranger; to them, 7, ¢e., to my Publishers and the select 
Reviewers, I say cordially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart, 

Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and 
approved me, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, 
bat not, therefore, to be overlooked. I mean the timorous or carp- 
ing few who doubt the tendency of such books as “Jane Eyre”: in 
whose eyes whatever is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each 
protest against bigotry—that parent of crime—an insult to piety, 
that regent of God on earth. I would suggest to such doubters cer- 
tain obvious distinctions; I would remind them of certain simple 
truths. . 

Conventionality is not morality. Self-righieousness is not reli- 
gion. To attack the first is not to assail the last. To pluck the mask 
from the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the 
Crown of Thorns.

These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as 
distinct as is vice from virtue. Men too often confound them: they 
should not be confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for 
truth; narrow human doctrines, that only tend to elate and mag- 
nify a few, should not be substituted for the world-redeeming creed 
of Christ. There is—I repeat it—a difference; and it is a good, and 
not a bad action to mark broadly and clearly the line of separation 
between them. 

The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has 
been accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make ex- 
ternal show pass for sterling worth—to let whitewashed walls 
vouch for clean shrines. It may hate him who dares to scrutinise 
and expose-—to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it—to 
penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but hate as it 
will, it is indebted to him. 

Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good 
concerning him, but evil: probably he liked the sycophant son of 
Chenaanah better; yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, 
had he but stopped his ears to flattery and opened them to faithful 
counsel. 

There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to 
tickle delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great 
ones of society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned 
Kings of Judah and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a 
power as prophet-like and as vital—a mien as dauntless and as 
daring, Is the satirist of “Vanity Fair” admired in high places? I 
cannot tell; but I think if some of those amongst whom he hurls 
the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over whom he flashes the levin- 
brand of his denunciation, were to take his warnings in time—they 
or their seed might yet escape a fatal Ramoth-Gilead. 

Why have I alluded to this man? I have alluded to him, Reader, 
because I think I see in him an intellect profounder and more 
unique than his contemporaries have yet recognised; because I re- 
gard him as the first social regenerator of the day—as the very 
master of that working corps who would restore to rectitude the 
warped system of things; because I think no commentator on his 
Writings has yet found the comparison that suits him, the terms 
which rightly characterise his talent. They say he is like Fielding; 
they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers. He resembles Fielding 


AUTHOR’S PREFACE Vv 


as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on carrion, but 
Thackeray never does. His wit is bright, his humour attractive, but 
both bear the same relation to his serious genius, that the mere 
lambent sheet-lightning, playing under the edge of the summer 
cloud, does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb. Finally; I 
have alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him—if he will accept 
the tribute of a total stranger—I have dedicated this second edition 
of “JANE Eyrt.”

Jane Eyre 


CHAPTER J 


“WNHERE was no possibility of taking a walk that day, We had been 

wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morn- 
ing; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined 
early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a 
rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the 
question. 

I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly after, 
noons; dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with 
nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, 
the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority 
to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. 

The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their 
mamma in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, 
and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor 
crying) looked perfectly happy. Me she had dispensed from joining the 
group, saying she regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a 
distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her 
own observation that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire g 
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly 
manner—something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were—she really 
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy 
little children, 

“What does Bessie say I have done?” I asked. 

“Jane, I don’t like cavillers or queslioners; besides, there is something 
truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner. Be seat- 
ed somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent.” 

I

A small breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room. I slipped in 
there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, 
taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into 
the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; 
and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in 
double retirement. 

Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left 
were the clear panes of glass, protecting but not separating me from the 
drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my 
book, I studied the aspect of thal winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a 
pale blank of mist and cloud; near, a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat 
shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and 
lamentable blast. 

I returned to my book—Bewick’s History of British Birds: the letter- 
press thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were 
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as 
a blank. They were these which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of “the 
solitary rocks and promontories” by them only inhabited; of the coast 
of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the Linde- 
ness, or Naze, to the North Cape,— 


“Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls, 
Boils round the naked, melancholy isles 
Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge 
Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.” 


Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lap- 
Jand, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with “the 
vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space, 
—that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumu- 
lation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, 
surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cald.” 
Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like 
all the half-comprehended notions that fleat dim through children’s 
brains, but strangely impressive. The words in these introductory pages 
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave signifi- 
cance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the 
broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon 
glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking. 


JANE EYRE 3 


I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, 
with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon 
girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the hour 
of eventide. 

The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea I believed to be marine 
phantoms, 

The fiend pinning down the thief’s pack behind him I passed over 
quickly: it was an object of terror. 

So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a dis- 
tant crowd surrounding a gallows. 

Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped un- 
derstanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as 
interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings, 
when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her 
jroning-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and 
while she got up Mrs. Reed’s lace frills, and crimped her nightcap bor- 
ders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken 
from old fairy tales and older ballads; or (as at a later period I discov- 
ered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland. 

With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my 
way. I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The 
breakfast-room door opened, 

“Boh! Madam Mope!” cried the voice of John Reed; then he 
paused: he found the room apparently empty. 

“Where the dickens is she?” he continued. “Lizzy! Georgy! (calling 
to his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mamma she is run out into the rain 
—bad animal!” 

“Tt is well I drew the curtain,” thought I; and I wished fervently he 
might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found 
it out himself—he was not quick either of vision or conception—but 
Eliza just put her head in at the door, and said at once,— 

“She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.” 

And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being 
dragged forth by the said Jack. 

“What do you wante” I asked, with awkward diffidence. 

“Say, ‘What do you want, Master Reed?’” was the answer. “I want 
you to come here;” and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by 
a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him. 

John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old—four years older 
than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and 
unwholesome skin; thick lincaments in a spacious visage, heavy litabs 
and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at table, which made 


4 JANE EYRE 


him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks. He 
ought now to have been at school, but his mamma had taken him home 
for a month or two, “on account of his delicate health.” Mr. Miles, the 
master, affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and 
sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother’s heart turned from an 
opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John’s 
sallowness was owing to over-application, and perhaps, to pining after 
home. 

John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an anti- 
pathy to me. He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the 
week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had 
feared him, and every morsel of flesh on my bones shrank when he came 
near. There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he in- 
spired, because I had no appeal whatever against. either his menaces or 
his inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by 
taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the 
subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did 
both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, be- 
hind her back. 

Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair. He spent some 
three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could with- 
out damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading 
the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who 
would presently deal it. I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, 
all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly. I tot- 
tered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from 
his chair. 

“That is for your impudence in answering mamma awhile since,” said 
he, “and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the 
took you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!” 

Accustomed to John Reed’s abuse, I never had an idea of replying to 
it; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow 
the insult. 

“What were you doing behind the curtain?” he asked. 

“T was reading.” 

“Show the book.” 

I returned to the window and fetched it thence. 

“Vou have no business to take our books; you are a dependant, mam- 
ma says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to 
beg, and not to live here with gentlemen’s children like us, and eat the 
same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mamma’s expense. Now, I'll 
teach you to rummage my book-shelves: for they are mine; all the house 


JANE EYRE 5 


belongs to me, or will do in a few years. Go and stand by the door, out 
of the way of the mirror and the windows.” 

I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw 
him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively 
started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough however; the volume 
was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and 
cutting it. The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its 
climax; other feelings succeeded. 

“Wicked and cruel boy!” I said. “You are like a murderer—you are 
like a slave-driver—you are like the Roman emperors!” 

I had read Goldsmith’s History of Rome, and had formed my opinion 
of Nero, Caligula, etc. Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I 
never thought thus to have declared aloud. 

“What! what!” he cried. “Did she say that to me? Did you hear her, 
Eliza and Georgiana? Won’t I tell mamma? but first-——” 

fle ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he 
had closed with a desperate thing. I really saw in him a tyrant, a mur- 
derer. I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, 
and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the 
time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort. I don’t 
very well know what I did with my hands, but he called me “Rat, rat!” 
and bellowed out aloud. Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had 
run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the 
scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot. We were parted: I heard 
the words,— 

“Dear! dear! What fury to fly at Master John!” 

“Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!” 

Then Mrs. Reed subjoined,— 

“Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.” Four hands 
were immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs. 


§ JANE EYRE 


CHAPTER II 


T reststep all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which 
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were dis- 
posed to entertain of me. The fact is, I was a irifle beside myself; or 
rather out of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a 
moment’s mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, 
and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go 
all lengths. 

“Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she’s like a mad cat.” 

“For shame! for shame!” cried the lady’s-maid. “What shocking con- 
duct, Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your bencfactress’s son! 
your young master!” 

“Master! How is he my master? Am I a servant?” 

“No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep. 
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness.” 

They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. 
Reed, and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it 
like a spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly. 

“Tf you don’t sit still, you must be tied down,” said Bessie. “Miss Ab- 
bot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly.” 

Miss Abbot tumed to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature, This 
preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a 
little of the excitement out of me, 

“Don’t take them off,” I cried; “I will not stir.” 

In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands. 

“Mind you don’t,” said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I 
was really subsiding, she’ loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Ab- 
bot stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as 
incredulous of my sanity. 

“She never did so before,” at Jast said Bessie, turning to the abigail. 

“But it was always in her,” was the reply. “I’ve told Missis often my 
opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me. She’s an underhand 
little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover.” 

Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said-— 

“You ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. 
Reed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go 
to the poorhouse.” 

I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me—my 
very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind. This 
reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: 


JANE EYRE 7 


very painful and crushing, but only half intelligible, Miss Abbot joined 
in,— 

“And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses 
Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought 
up with them. They will have a great deal of money, and you will have 
none: it is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agree- 
able to them.” 

“What we tell you is for your good,” added Bessie, in no harsh voice; 
“you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have 
a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send 
you away, I am sure.” 

“Besides,” said Miss Abbot, “God will punish her: He might strike 
her dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go? 
Come, Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn’t have her heart for anything, 
Say your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don’t 
repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney 
and fetch you away.” 

They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them, 

The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in-~I might 
say never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead 
Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it 
contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the 
mansion, A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with 
curtains of deep red damask, stook out like a tabernacle in the centre; 
the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down,.were half 
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red; 
the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the 
walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe, 
the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany. Out 
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled- 
up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles 
counterpane, Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy- 
chair near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and 
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne. 

This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, be- 
cause remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was 
known to be so seldom entered, The housemaid alone came here on Sat- 
urdays, to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week’s quiet dust: 
and Mrs, Reed herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents 
of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers 
parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; 
and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room—the spell which 
kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur. 


8 JANE EYRE 


Mr. Reed had been dead nine years; it was in this chamber he 
breathed his last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the 
undertaker’s men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration 
had guarded it from frequent intrusion. 

My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted, 
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece. The bed rose before 
me; to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, 
broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the 
muffled windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the va- 
sant majesty of the bed and room. I was not quite sure whether they 
had locked the door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to sec. 
Alas! yes: no jail was ever more secure. Returning, I had to cross before 
the looking-glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth 
it revealed. All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than 
in reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white 
face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving 
where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like 
one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie’s evening stories 
represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in the moors, and ap- 
pearing before the eyes of belated travellers. I returned to my stool. 

Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour 
for complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted 
slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid 
rush of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present. ~ 

All John Reed’s violent tyrannies, all his sisters’ proud indifference, all 
his mother’s aversion, all the servants’ partiality, turned up in my dis- 
turbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well. Why was I always suf- 
fering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned? Why 
could I never please? Why was it useless to try to win any one’s favour? 
Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected. Georgiana, who 
had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage, 
was universally indulged; her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls, 
seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase indem- 
nity for every fault, John no one thwarted, much less punished; though 
he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks, set the 
dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruil, and broke 
the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called his mother 
“old girl,” too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin, similar to his 
own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore and spoiled 
her silk attire; and he was still “her own darling.” I dared commit no 
fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty and tire- 
some, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to 
night. 


JANE EYRE 9 


My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: 
no one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had 
turned against him to avert further irrational violence, I was loaded with 
general opprobrium. 

“Unjust !—unjust!” said my reason, forced by the agonizing stimulus 
into precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought 
up, instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupport- 
able oppression—as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never 
eating or drinking more, and letting myself die. 

What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon! How 
all my brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection! Yet in 
what darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought! I 
could not answer the ceaseless inward question—why I thus suffered; 
now, at the distance of—I will not say how many years, I see it clearly. 

I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had 
nothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassa- 
lage. If they did not love me, in fact as little did I love them. They 
were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympa- 
thize with one amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in 
temperament, in capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of 
serving their interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cher- 
ishing the germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their 
judgment. I know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exact- 
ing, handsome, romping child--though equally dependent and friendless 
~—Mrs, Reed would have endured my presence more complacently; her 
children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow- 
feeling; the servants would have been less prone to make me the scape- 
goat of the nursery. 

Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o’clock, and 
the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight. I heard the rain 
still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling 
in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then 
my courage sank. My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn 
depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire, All said I was 
wicked, and perhaps I might be so: what thought had I been but just 
conceiving of starving myself to death? That certainly was a crime: and 
was I fit to die? Or was the vault under the chance! of Gateshead 
Church an inviting bourne? In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed 
lie buried; and Jed by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with 
gathering dread, I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my 
own uncle-—my mother’s brother—that he had taken me when a parent- 
Jess infant to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a 
promise of Mrs, Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her 


10 JANE EYRE 


own children. Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise 
—~and so she had, I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her— 
bul how could she really like an interloper not of her race, and uncon- 
nected with her, after her husband’s death, by any tie? It must have 
been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand 
in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see 
an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group. 

A singular notion dawned upon me. I doubted not——never doubted— 
that if Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and 
now, as I sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls—occa- 
sionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly-gleaming mirror 
—I began to recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their 
graves by the violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish 
the perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed’s spirit, 
harassed by the wrongs of his sister’s child, might quit its abode—wheth- 
er in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed—and rise 
before me in this chamber. I wiped my tears and hushed my sobs, fear- 
ful Jest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to 
comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed face, bending over me 
with strange pity. This idea, consolatory in theory, I felt would be ter- 
rible if realized: with all my might I endeavoured to stifle ii—I en- 
deavoured to be frm. Shaking my hair from my eyes, I lifted my head 
and tried to look boldly round the dark room; at this moment a light 
gleamed on the wall. Was it, I asked myself, a ray from the moon pene- 
trating some aperture in the blind? No; moonlight was still, and this 
stirred; while I gazea, it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over my 
head. I can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was, in all 
likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn: 
but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken as my nerves were 
by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some com- 
ing vision from another world. My heart beat thick, my head grew hot; 
a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of wings; something 
seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance broke down; I 
rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort. Steps came 
running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and Abbot 
entered, 

“Miss Eyre, are you ill?” said Bessie. 

“What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!” exclaimed Abbot. 

“Take me out! Let me go into the nursery!” was my cry. 

“What for? Are you hurt? Have you seen something?” again de- 
manded Bessie. 

“Oh! I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come.” I had now 
got hold of Bessie’s hand, and she did not snatch it from me. 


JANE EYRE ur 


“She has screamed out on purpose,” declared Abbot, in some disgust. 
“And what a scream! If she had been in great pain one would have ex- 
cused it, but she only wanted to bring us all here. I know her naughty 
tricks.” 

“What is all this?” demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. 
Reed came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling 
stormily. “Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre 
should be left in the red-room till I came to her myself.” 

“Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma’am,” pleaded ‘Bessie. 

“Let her go,” was the only answer. ‘Loose Bessie’s hand, child: you 
cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured. I abhor arti- 
fice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks will 
not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on con- 
dition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you then.” 

“O aunt! have pity! Forgive me! I cannot endure it—let me be pun- 
ished some other way! I shall be killed if iu 

“Silence! This violence is all most repulsive:” and so, no doubt, she 
felt it. I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on 
me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous 
duplicity. 

Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now 
frantic anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, 
without further parley. I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she 
was gone, I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the 
scene, 


CHAPTER IIT 


Tae next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had a 
frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed 
with thick black bars. I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow sound, 
and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation, uncertainty, and 
ag all-predominating sense of terror confused my faculties. Ere long, I 
became aware that some one was handling me; lifting me up and sup- 
porting me in a sitting posture, and that more tenderly than I had ever 
been raised or upheld before. I rested my head against a pillow or an 
arm, and felt easy. 

In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew 
quite well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nur- 
sery fire, It was night: a candle burned on the table; Bessie stood at 
the bedfoot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair 
near my pillow, leaning over me. 


12 JANE EYRE 


I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and 
security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an indi- 
vidual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed. Turn- 
ing from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me than 
that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinized the face of 
the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary, sometimes 
called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for herself and 
the children she employed a physician. 

“Well, who am I?” he asked. 

I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he 
took it, smiling and saying, “We shall do very well by-and-by.” Then he 
laid me down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that 
I was not disturbed during the night. Having given some further direc- 
tions, and intimated that he should call again the next day, he departed; 
to my grief: I felt so shellered and befriended while he sat in the chair 
near my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room dark- 
ened and my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down, 

“Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?” asked Bessie, rather 
softly. : 

Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be 
rough, “I will try.” 

“Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?” 

“No, thank you, Bessie.” 

“Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o’clock; but you 
may call me if you want anything in the night.” 

Wonderful civility this! It emboldened me to ask a question, 

“Bessic, what is the matter with me? Am I ill?” 

“You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be bet- 
ter soon, no doubt.” 

Bessie went into the housemaid’s apartment, which was near. I heard 
her say,— 

“Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren’t for my life 
be alone with that poor child to-night: she might die. It’s such a strange 
thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything. Missis was 
rather too hard.” 

Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whis- 
pering together for half an hour before they fell asleep. I caught scraps 
of their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer 
the main subject discussed, 

“Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished’*—“A great 
black dog behind him”—“Three loud raps on the chamber door’—* 
light in the churchyard just above his grave,” etc., etc. 

At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out. For me, the 


JANE EYRE 13 


watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; ear, eye, and 
mind were alike strained by dread—such dread as children only can feel. 

No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the 
red-room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverbera- 
tion to this day, Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of 
mental suffering; but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what 
you did: while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only 
uprooting my bad propensities. 

Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shaw! 
by the nursery hearth. I felt physically weak and broken down: but my 
worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind—a wretched- 
ness which kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped 
one salt drop from my cheek than another followed. Yet, I thought, I 
ought to have been happy, for none of the Reeds were there; they were 
all gone out in the carriage with their mamma. Abbot, too, was sewing in 
another room; and Bessie, as shé moved hither and thither, putting away 
toys and arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word 
of unwonted kindness. This staie of things should have been to me a 
paradise of peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand 
and thankless fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a 
slate that no calm could soothe and no pleasure excite them agreeably. 

Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a 
tart on a certain brightly-painted china plate, whose bird of paradise, 
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in 
me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration: and which plate I had often 
petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more 
closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a privi- 
lege. This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was cor- 
dially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it. Vain favour! 
coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished for, too 
late! I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird, the tints of 
the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and tart away. 
Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word book acted as a transient 
stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gudllaver’s Travels from the library. 
This book I had again and again perused with delight. I considered it 
a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper than 
what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves, having sought them in 
vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under mushrooms and beneath the 
ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at length made up my mind 
to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of England to some savage 
country where the woods were wilder and thicker, and the population 
more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdingnag, being, in my creed, 
solid parts of the earth’s surface, I doubted not that I might one day, 


14 JANE EYRE 


by taking a long voyage, sce with my own eyes the little fields, houses, 
and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds of the 
one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs, the mon- 
ster cats, the tower-like men and women of the other. Yet, when this 
cherished volume was now placed in my hand—when I turned over its 
leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now, 
never failed to find—all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt 
goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most deso- 
late wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions. I closed the book, 
which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the 
untasted tart. 

Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having 
washed her hands, she opened a certain little drawer full of splendid 
shreds of silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana’s 
doll. Meantime she sang: her song was— 


“In the days when we went gipsying, 
A long time ago.” 


I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for 
Bessie had a sweet voice—at least, I thought so. But now, though her 
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness. 
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, 
very lingeringly; “A long time ago” came out like the saddest cadence 
of a funeral hymn. She passed into another ballad, this time a really 
doleful one. 


“My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary; 
Long is the way, and the mountains are wild; 
Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary 
Over the path of the poor orphan child, 


“Why did they send me so far and so lonely, 
Up where the moors spread and gray rocks are piled? 
Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only 
Watch o’er the steps of a poor orphan child, 


“Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing, 
Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild; 
God, in His mercy, protection is showing, 
Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child, 


“Ev'n should I fall o’er the broken bridge passing, 
Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled, 
Still will my Father, with promise and blessing, 
Take to His bosom the poor orphan child. 


JANE EYRE 15 


“There is a thought that for strength should avail me, 
Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled ; 
Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me; 
God is a friend to the poor orphan child.” 


“Come, Miss Jane, don’t cry,” said Bessie as she finished. She might 
as well have said to the fire, “Don’t burn!” but how could she divine the 
morbid suffering to which I was a prey? In the course of the morning 
Mr. Lloyd came again. 

“What, already up!” said he, as he entered the nursery. “Well, nurse, 
how is she?” 

Bessie answered that I was doing very well. 

“Then she ought to look more cheerful. Come here, Miss Jane: your 
name is Jane, is it notP” 

“Ves, sir—Jane Eyre.” 

“Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what 
about? Have you any pain?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Oh! I dare say she is crying because she could not go ont with Missis 
in the carriage,” interposed Bessie. 

“Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness.” 

I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false 
charge, I answered promptly, “I never cried for such a thing in my life: 
T hate going out in the carriage. I cry because I am miserable.” 

“Oh, fie, Miss!” said Bessie. 

The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled. I was standing before 
him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily. His eyes were small and 
gray; not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: 
he had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face. Having consid- 
ered me at leisure, he said — 

“What made you ill yesterday?” 

“She had a fall,” said Bessie, again putting in her word. 

“Fall! why, that is like a baby again! Can’t she manage to walk at 
her age? She must be eight or nine years old.” 

“T was knocked down,” was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me 
by another pang of mortified pride; “but that did not make me ill,” I 
added, while Mr, Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff. 

As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang 
for the servants’ dinner; he knew what it was. “That’s for you, nurse,” 
said he; “you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come 
back.” 

Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because 
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall. 


16 JANE EYRE 


“The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?” pursued Mr. Lloyd 
when Bessie was gone. 

“T was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark.” 

I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time. “Ghosts! What, 
you are a baby after all! Vou are afraid of ghosts?” 

“Of Mr. Reed’s ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out 
there. Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they 
can help it; and if was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle~so 
cruel that I think I shall never forget it,” 

“Nonsense! And is it that makes you so miserable? Are you afraid 
now in daylight?” 

“No; but night will come again before long: and besides—I am un- 
happy—very unhappy, for other things.” 

“What olher things? Can you tell me some of them?” 

Tfow much I wished to reply fully to this question! How difficult it 
was to frame any answer! Children can feel, but they cannot analyze 
their feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they 
know not how to express the result of the process in words, Fearful, 
however, of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief 
by imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre, 
though, as far as it went, true response. 

“For one thing, I have no father and mother, brothers or sisters.” 

“You have a kind aunt and cousins.” 

Again I paused; then bunglingly announced, — 

“But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the 
red-room.” 

Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box. 

‘Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?” asked he. 
“Are you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?” 

“Tt is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here 
than a servant.” 

“Pooh! you can’t be silly enough ta wish to leave such a splendid 
place?” 

“Tf I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave il; but I can 
never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman.” 

“Perhaps you may~—who knows? Have you any relations besides 
Mrs, Reed?” 

"T think not, sir.” 

“None belonging to your father?” 

“T don’t know: I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might 
have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about 
them.” 

“If you had such, would you like to go to them?” 


JANE EYRE 17 


I reflected. Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to 
children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable 
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes, 
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty 
for me was synonymous with degradation. 

“No; I should not like to belong to poor people,” was my reply. 

“Not even if they were kind to you?” 

J shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of 
being kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their man- 
ners, to be uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women J saw 
sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage 
doors of the village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to pur- 
chase liberty at the price of caste. 

“But are your relatives so very poor? Are they working people?” 

“T cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if { have any, they must be a beggarly 
set: I should not like to go a-begging.” i 

“Would you like to go to school?” ar. 

Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was! Bessie sometimes 
spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat ih the stocks, wore back- 
boards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John 
Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed’s tastes 
were no rule for mine, and if Bessie’s ‘accounts of school discipline 
(gathered from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before 
coming to Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain 
accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought, 
equally attractive. She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and 
flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could 
play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate: 
till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened. Besides, school 
would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire separa- 
tion from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life. 

“T should indeed like to go to school,” was the audible conclusion of 
my musings. 

“Well, well! who knows what may happen?” said Mr, Lloyd, as he 
got up. “The child ought to have change of air and scene,” he added, 
speaking to himself; “nerves not in a good state.” 

Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard 
rolling up the gravel-walk. 

‘Ys that your mistress, nurse?” asked Mr. Lloyd. “I should like to 
speak to her before I go.” 

Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way 
out. In the interview which followed between him and Mrs, Reed, 1 
presume, from after-occurrences. that the apothecary ventured to rec- 


18 JANE EYRE 


ommend my being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt 
veadily enough adopted, for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with 
Bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, 
and, as they thought, asleep, “Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to 
get rid of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if 
she ‘were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand,”” Abbot, I 
think, gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes, 

On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot’s 
communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; 
that my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who 
considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so 
irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that after 
my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the 
typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing 
town where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then 
prevalent; that my mother took the infection from him, and both died 
within @ month of each other, 

Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed, and said, “Poor Miss 
Jane is to be pitied, too, Abbot.” 

“Yes,” responded Abbot; “if she were a nice, pretty child, one might 
compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a 
little toad as that,” 

“Not a great deal, to be sure,” agreed Bessie: “at any rate, a beauty 
like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition.” 

“Yes, I dote on Miss Georgiana!” cried the fervent Abbot. “Little 
darling !—with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour 
as she has; just as if she were painted!—Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh 
rabbit for supper.” 

“So could I—with a roast onion. Come, we'll go down.” They went. 


CHAPTER IV 


From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported con- 
ference between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice 
, 48 a motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,—I desired 
and waited it in silence. It tarried, however. Days and weeks passed: I 
had regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made 
to the subject over which I brooded. Mrs, Reed surveyed me at times 
with a severe eye, hut seldom addressed me: since my illness she had 
drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her 
own children; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, con- 


JANE EYRE 19 


demning me to take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nur- 
sery, while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room. Not a 
hint, however, did she drop about sending me to school: still I felt an 
instinctive certainty that she would not long endure me under the same 
roof with her; for her glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, 
expressed an insuperable and rooted aversion. 

Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to 
me as little as possible. John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever 
he saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned 
against him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate 
revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to 
desist, and ran from me uttering execrations, and vowing J had burst his 
nose, I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as 
my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look 
daunted him, I had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage 
to purpose: but he was already with his mamma. I heard him in a blub- 
bering tone commence the tale of how “that nasty Jane Eyre” had flown 
at him like a mad cat: he was stopped rather harshly. 

“Don’t talk to me about her, John, I told you not to go near her; 
she is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sis- 
ters should associate with her.” 

Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at 
all deliberating on my words,— 

“They are not fit to associate with me.” 

Mrs, Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange 
and audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stairs, swept me like 
a whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my 
crib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one 
syllable, during the remainder of the day. 

“What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?” was my 
scarcely voluntary demand. I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if 
my tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utter- 
ance: something spoke out of me over which I had no control. 

“What!” said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold com- 
posed gray eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand 
from my arm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether 
I were child or fiend. I was now in for it. 

“My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and 
so can papa and mamma: they know how you shut me up all day long, 
and how you wish me dead,” 

Mrs, Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she 
boxed both my ears, and then left me without a word. Bessie supplied 
the hiatus by a homily of an hour’s length, in which she proved beyond 


20 JANE EYRE 


a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared 
under a roof. I half believed her, for I felt indeed only bad feelings 
surging in my breast. 

November, December, and half of January passed away, Christmas 
and the New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual 
festive cheer; presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening par- 
ties given. From every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share 
of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and 
Georgiana, and seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out 
in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; 
and afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played 
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the 
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken 
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed, 
When tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the 
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not 
miserable. To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company, 
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been 
kind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the 
evenings quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable 
eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen, But Bessie, as 
soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the 
lively regions of the kitchen and housekeepet’s room, generally hearing 
the candle along with her. I then sat with my doll on my knee till the 
fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse 
than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank Lo a 
dull red, I undressed hastily, iugging at knots and strings as I best 
might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib, To this 
crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in 
the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleas- 
ure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a minia- 
ture scarecrow, It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd 
sincerity I doted on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of 
sensation. I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and 
when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing 
it to be happy likewise. 

Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the com- 
pany, and listened for the sound of Bessie’s step on the stairs: some- 
times she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scis- 
sors, or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper—a bun ora 
cheese-cake—then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I 
had finished she would tuck the clothes round me, and (wice she kissed 
me, and said, “Good-night, Miss Jane,” When thus gentle, Bessie seem- 


JANE EYRE 2i 


ed to me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and T wished 
most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and 
never push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was tao 
offen wont to do, Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good 
natural capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable 
knack of narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on 
me by her nursery tales. She was pretty too, if my recollections of her 
face and person are correct. I remember her as a slim young woman, 
with black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear com- 
plexion; but she had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas 
of principle or justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one 
else at Gateshead Hall, 

Tt was the fifteenth of January, abeut nine e’clock in the morning. 
Bessie was down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned 
to their mamma; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden- 
coat to go and feed her poultry, an occupation ef which she was fond— 
and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up 
the money she thus obtained. She had a turn for traffic, and a marked 
propensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chick- 
ens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower- 
roots, seeds, and slips of plants, that functionary having orders from 
Mrs, Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she 
wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she 
could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to her money, she first 
secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but 
some of these hoards having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, 
fearful of one day losing her valued treasure, consented to entrust it to 
her mother, at a usurious rate of interest—fifty or sixty per cent., which 
interest she exacted every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book 
with anxious accuracy. 

Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and in- 
terweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of which 
she had found a store in a drawer in the attic. I was making my bed, 
having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before she 
returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under- 
nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, etc.). Having spread 
the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put 
in order some picture-books and doll’s house furniture scattered there. 
An abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the 
tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) 
stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to 
breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and 
thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the 


22 JANE EYRE 


grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard 
frost. 

From this window were visible the porter’s lodge and the carriage- 
road, and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage 
veiling the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open 
and a carriage roll through. I watched it ascending the drive with indif- 
ference—carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought 
visitors in whom I was interested—it stopped in front of the house, the 
door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted, All this being noth- 
ing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the 
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the 
twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the case- 
ment, The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the 
table, and having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to 
put out the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running up- 
stairs into the nursery. 

“Miss Jane, take off your pinafore;—what are you doing there? Have 
you washed your hands and face this morning?” I gave another tug 
before I answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the 
sash yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the 
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied— 

“No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.” 

“Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now? You look 
quite xed, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you open- 
ing the window for?” 

I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great 
a hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand, in- 
flicted a merciless but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with 
soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly 
brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of 
the stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast- 
room. 

I would have asked who wanted me; I would have demanded if Mrs. 
Reed was there: but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nur- 
sery door upon me, I slowly descended. For nearly three months I 
had never been called to Mrs. Reed’s presence; restricted so long to the 
nursery, the breakfast, dining, and drawing rooms were become for me 
awful regions, on which it dismayed me to intrude. 

I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room 
door, and I stopped, intimidated and trembling. What a miserable little 
poltroon had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in 
those days! I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward 


JANE EYRE 23 


to the parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation: the vehement 
ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I must enter. 

“Who could want me?” I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turn. 
ed the stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts. 
“What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?—a man or a 
woman?” The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through 
and curtsying lew, I looked up at—a black pillar!—such, at least, ap- 
peared to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape 
standing erect on the rug: the grim face at the top was like a carved 
mask, placed above the shaft by way of capital. 

Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside. She made a signal 
to me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger 
with the words, “This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to you.” 

He, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, 
and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking gray eyes 
which twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a 
bass voice, “Her size is small: what is her age?” 

“Ten years.” 

“So much?” was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny 
for some minutes. Presently he addressed me,— 

“Vour name, little girl?” 

“Jane Eyre, sir.” 

In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentle- 
man—but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and 
all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim. 

“Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?” 

Impossible to reply to this in the affrmative—my little world held a 
contrary opinion—I was silent. Mrs. Reed answered for me by an ex- 
pressive shake of the head, adding soon, “Perhaps the Jess said on that 
subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.” 

“Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;” and bend- 
ing from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair 
opposite Mrs, Reed’s. “Come here,” he said, 

I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before 
him, What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! 
what a great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth! 

“No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,” he began, “especially a 
naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?” 

“They go to hell,” was my ready and orthodox answer. 

“And what is hell? Can you tell me that?” 

“A pit full of fire.” 

“And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for 
sever?” 


24 JANE EYRE 

“No, sir.” 

“What must you do to avoid it?” 

T deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objection. 
able: “I must keep in good health, and not die.” 

“How can you keep in good health? Children younger than you die 
daily. I buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since-~ 
a good liltle child, whose soul is now in heaven. It is to be feared the 
same could not be said of you were you to be called hence.” 

Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes 
down on the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing my- 
self far enough away. 

“T hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever hav- 
ing been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress.” 

“Benefactress! benefactress!” said I inwardly; “they all call Mrs. 
Reed my benefactress: if so, a benefactress is a disagrecable thing.” 

“Do you say your prayers night and morning?” continued my in- 
terrogator, 

> “Yes, sir.” 

“Do you read your Bible?” 

“Sometimes.” 

“With pleasure? Are you fond of it?” 

“I like Revelation, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, 
and a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and 
Job and Jonah,” 

“And the Psalms? I hope you like them?” 

“No, sir.” 

“No? Oh, shocking! I havea little boy, younger than you, who knows 
six psalms by heart; and when you ask him which he would rather have, 
a gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a psalm to learn, he says: ‘Oh! the 
verse of a psalm! angels sing psalms,’ says he; ‘I wish to be a little 
angel here below;’ he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant 
piety.” 

“Psalms are not interesting,” I remarked. 

“That proves you have a wicked heart; and you musl pray to God 
to change it—to give you a new and clean one—to take away your heart 
of stone and give you a heart of flesh.” 

I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which 
that operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs, 
Read interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry 
on the conversation herself. 

“Mr, Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote 
to you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character 
and disposition I could wish. Should you admit her into Lowood school, 


JANE EYRE 25 


I should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to 
keep a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, 
a tendency to deceit. I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may 
not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst.” 

Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her 
nature to wound me cruelly. Never was I happy in her presence. How- 
ever carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my 
efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the ahove. 
Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart. I 
dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new 
phase of existence which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could 
not have expressed the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkind» 
ness along my future path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. 
Brocklehurst’s eye into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do to 
remedy the injury? 

“Nothing, indeed,” thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and 
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish. 

“Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,” said Mr. Brocklehurst; “it 
is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake 
burning with fire and brimstone. She shall, however, be watched, Mrs. 
Recd; I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.” 

“J should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her pros- 
pects,” continued my benefactress—‘‘to be made useful, to be kept 
humble: as for the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend 
them always at Lowood.” 

“Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,” returned Mr. 
Brocklehurst. “Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly ap- 
propriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial care 
shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them. I have studied how 
best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the 
other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success. My second daughter, 
Augusta, went with her mamma to visit the school, and on her return 
she exclaimed, ‘Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lo- 
wood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long 
pinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their frocks—they are 
almost like poor people’s children! and,’ said she, ‘they looked at my 
dress and mamma’s, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.’” 

“This is the state of things I quite approve,” returned Mrs. Reed; 
“had I sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system 
more exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre. Consistency, my dear Mr. 
Brocklehurst-—JI advocate consistency in all things.” 

“Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been 
abserved in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lo- 


26 JANE EYRE 


wood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy 
and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its in- 
habitants.” 

“Quite right, sir, I may then depend upon this child being received as 
a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her posi- 
tion and prospects?” 

“Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen 
plants, and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable 
privilege of her election.” 

“J will send her then as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I 
assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility. that was be- 
coming too irksome.” 

“No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good-morning. I 
shall return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my 
good friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner. 
I shall send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that 
there will be no difficulty about receiving her. Good-bye.” 

“Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss 
Brocklehurst, and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton 
Brocklehurst.” 

“I will, madam, Little girl, here is a book entitled the Child’s Guide; 
read it with prayer, especially that part containing ‘An account of the 
awfully sudden death of Martha G——, a naughty child addicted to 
falsehood and deceit.’” 

With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pam- 
phlet sewn in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed. 

Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; 
she was sewing, I was watching her. Mrs. Reed might be at that time 
some six or seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square- 
shouldered and strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: 
she had a somewhat large face, the under jaw being much developed and 
very solid; her brow was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and 


nose sufficiently regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye ; 


devoid of ruth; her skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her . 
constitution was sound as a bell—illness never came near her; she was | 


an exact, clever manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly 
under her control; her children only at times defied her authority and 
laughed it to scorn; she dressed well, and had a presence and port cal- 
culated to set off handsome attire, 

Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her 
figure, 1 perused her features. In mv hand I held the tract containing 
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been 
pointed as to an appropriate warning. What had just pgssed; what Mrs, 


JANE EYRE 27 


Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst—the whole tenor of 
their conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt 
every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of re- 
sentment fomented now within me. 

Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her 
fingers at the same time suspended their nimble movements. 

“Go out of the room; return to the nursery,” was her mandate. My 
look or something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke 
with extreme though suppressed irritation. I got up, I went to the 
door; I came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then 
close up to her. 

Speak I musi-—I had been trodden on severely, and mus¢ turn—but 
how? What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist? I gath- 
ered my energies and Jaunched them in this blunt sentence-— 

“T am not deceitful. If I were, I should say I loved you; but I de- 
clare I do not love you. I dislike you the worst of anybody in the 
world except John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to 
your girl, Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I.” 

Mrs. Reed’s hands still lay on her work inactive; her eye of ice con- 
tinued to dwell freezingly on mine. 

“What more have you to say?” she asked, rather in the tone in which 
a person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordi- 
narily used to a child. 

That eye of hers, that voice stirred every snapathy: l had. Shaking 
from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued,— 

“T am glad you are no relation of mine; I will never call you aunt 
again as long as I live. I will never come to see you when I am grown 
up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I 
will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you trealed 
me with miserable cruelty.” 

“Slow dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?” 

“How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth, You 
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or 
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity, I shall remem- 
ber how you thrust me back—roughly and violently thrust me back— 
into the red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day—though ¥ 
was in agony, though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, ‘Have 
mercy! Have mercy, Aunt Reed!’ And that punishment you made me 
suffer because your wicked boy struck me—knocked me down for noth- 
ing, I will tell anybody who asks me questions this exact tale. People: 
think you a good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted. Yow are de- 
ceitful!? 

Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with 


28 JANE EYRE 


the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It seemed as if 
an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped- 
for liberty. Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked 
frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her 
hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she 
would cry. 

“Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you? Why 
do you tremble so violently? Would you like to drink some water?” 

“No, Mrs. Reed.” 

“Ts there anything else you wish for, Jane? I assure you, I desire to 
be your friend.” 

“Not you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a de- 
ceitful disposition; and I’H let everybody at Lowood know what you 
are, and what you have done.” 

“Jane, you don’t understand these things: children must be cor- 
rected for their faults,” 

“Deceit is not my fault!” I cried out in a savage, high voice. 

“But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow, And now return 
to the nursery—there’s a dear—and lic down a little,” 

“Tam not your dear; I cannot lie down. Send me to school soon, 
Mrs. Reed, for I hate to live here.” 

“T will indeed send her to school soon,” murmured Mrs. Reed sotto 
veces and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment, 

I was left there alone—winner of the field. It was the hardest battle 
Thad fought, and the first victory I had gained. I stood awhile on the 
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conquerar’s 
solitude. Tirst, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce pleasure 
subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my pulses, A child 
cannot quarrel with its elders as I had done, cannot give its furious 
feelings uncontrolled play as I had given mine, without experiencing 
afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction. A ridge of 
lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a meet em- 
blem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same 
ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have repre- 
sented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half an hour’s silence 
and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the dreari- 
ness of my hated and hating position. 

Something of vengeance { had tasted for the first Lime: as aromatic 
wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy; its after-flavour, metal- 
Ke and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned. Will- 
ingly would I now have gone and asked Mrs, Reed’s pardon; but I 
knew, partly from experience and partly from instinct, that was the 


JANE EYRE 29 


way to make her repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every 
turbulent impulse of my nature. 

I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking; 
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre 
indignation. I took a book—some Arabian tales; I sat down and en- 
deavoured to read. I could make no sense of the subject; my own 
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found 
fascinating. I opened the glass door in the breakfast-room: the shrub- 
bery was quite still; the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or breeze, 
through the grounds. I covered my head and arms with the skirt of my 
frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was quite 
sequestered; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the falling fir- 
cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept by past winds 
in heaps, and now stiffened together. I leaned against a gate, and looked 
into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where the short grass 
was nipped and blanched. It was a very gray day; a most opaque sky, 
“onding on snaw,” canopied all; thence flakes fell at intervals, which 
settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without melting. I stood, 
a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and over again, 
“What shall I do? what shall I do?” 

All at once J heard a clear voice call, “Miss Jane! where are you? 
Come to lunch!” 

It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir: her light step 
came tripping down the path. 

“You naughty little thing!” she said. “Why don’t you come when 
you are called?” 

Bessie’s presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had 
been brooding, seemed cheerful, even though, as usual, she was some- 
what cross. The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. 
Reed, I was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid’s transitory 
anger; and I was disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart. I 
just put my two arms round her and said, “Come, Bessie, don’t scold.” 

Thé action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated 
to indulge in: somehow it pleased her. 

“You are a strange child, Miss Jane,” she said, as she looked down at 
me—‘a little roving, solitary thing! And you are going to school, I 
suppose?” 

I nodded. 

“And won’t you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?” 

“What does Bessie care for me? She is always scolding me.” 

“Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing. You should 
be bolder.” 

“What! to get more knocks?” 


30 JANE EYRE 


“Nonsense! But you are rather put upon, that’s certain. My mother 
said, when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little 
one of her own to be in your place-—Now, come in, and I’ve some 
good news for you.” ‘ 

“JT don’t think you have, Bessie.” 

“Child! what do you mean? What sorrowful eyes you fix on mel 
Well, but Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to 
tea this afternoon, and you shall! have tea with me. I’) ask cook to bake 
you'a little cake; and then you shall help me to look over your drawers, 
for I am soon to pack your trunk. Missis intends you to leave Gates- 
head in a day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take 
with you.” 

“Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go.” 

“Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don’t be afraid 
of me. Don’t start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it’s so pro- 
voking.” 

“TY don’t think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I 
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to 
dread.” 

“Tf you dread them they’ll dislike you.” 

“As you do, Bessie?” 

“{ don’t dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all 
the others.” 

“You don’t show it.” 

“Vou little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking. What 
makes you so venturesome and hardy?” 

“Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides”—IJ was going to 
say something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but 
on second thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head, 

“And so you’re glad to leave me?” 

“Not at all, Bessic; indeed, just now I’m rather sorry.” 

“Just now! and rather! How coolly my little lady says it! I dare say 
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn’t give it me; you'd say 
you'd rather not.” 

“Tl kiss you and welcome: bend your head down,” Bessie stooped; 
we mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite com- 
forted. That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the even- 
ing Bessie told me some of her most enchaining stories, and sang me 
some of her sweetest songs. Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine. 


JANE EYRE 31 


CHAPTER V 


Five o’ctock had hardly struck on the morning of the roth of January, 
when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up 
and nearly dressed. I had risen half an hour before her entrance, and 
had washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half- moon 
just setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my 
crib. I was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the 
lodge gates at 6 a.m. Besste was the only person yet risen; she had lit 
a fire in the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast. 
Tew children can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor 
could I. Bessie, having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of 
the boiled milk and bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some 
biscuits in a paper and put them into my bag; then she helped me on 
with my pelisse and bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I 
left the nursery. As we passed Mrs, Reed’s bedroom, she said, “Will you 
fo in and bid Missis good-bye?” 

“No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone 
down to supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my 
cousins cither; and she told me to remember that she had always been 
my best friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly.” 

“What did you say, Miss?” 

“Nothing; I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from 
her to the wall.” 

“That was wrong, Miss Jane.” 

“Tt was quite right, Bessie. Your Missis has not been my friend; she 
has been my foe.” 

“© Miss Jane! don’t say so!” 

“Good-bye to Gateshead!” cried I, as we passed through the hall and 
went out at the front door. 

The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, 
whose light glanced on wet, steps and gravel road socden by a recent 
thaw, Raw "and chill was the winter morning; my teeth chattered as 1 
hastened down the drive. There was a light in the porter’s lodge. When 
we reached it, we found the porter’s wife just kindling her fire: my 
trunk, which had been carried down the evening before, stood corded at 
the door. It wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that 
hour had struck, the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach. 
I went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the 
gloom. 

"Ts she going by herself?” asked the porter’s wife. 


32 JANE EYRE 


“Vas,” 

“And how far is it?” 

“Fifty miles,” 

“What a long way! I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so 
far alone.” 

The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and 
its top laden with passengers. The guard and coachmen loudly urged 
haste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie’s neck, to 
which I clung with kisses. 

“Be sure and take good care of her,” cried she to the guard, as he 
lifted me into the inside. 

“Ay, ay!? was the answer. The door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed 
“All right,” and on we drove. Thus was I severed from Bessie and 
Gateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, re- 
mote and mysterious regions. 

T remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seem- 
ed to me of preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over 
hundreds of miles of road. We passed through several towns, and in 
one, a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, 
and the passengers alighted to dine. I was carried into an inn, where 
the guard wanted me to have some dinner; but, as T had no appetite, he 
left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier 
pendent from the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the 
wall filled with musical instruments. Here I walked about for a long 
time, feeling very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one com-~ 
ing in and kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits 
haying frequently figured in Bessie’s fireside chronicles. At last the 
guard returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my pro- 
tector mounted his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we 
ratlled over the “stony street” of L-——~. 

The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty. As it waned into 
dusk, I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gates+ 
head: we ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great 
gray hills heaved up round the horizon. As twilight deepened, we de- 
scended a valley, dark with wood, and long after night had oerclouded 
the prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees. 

Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep. I had not long slumber- 
ed when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me. The coach door 
was open, and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face 
and dress by the light of the lamps. 

“Ts there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?” she asked. I answered 
“Yes,” and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the 
coach instantly drove away. 


JANE EYRE 33 


I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion 
of the coach: gathering my faculties, I looked about me. Rain, wind, 
and darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before 
me and a door open in it. Through this door I passed with my new 
guide: she shut and locked it behind her. There was now visible a house 
or houses—for the building spread far—with many windows, and lights 
burning in some. We went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and 
were admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into 
a room with a fire, where she left me alone. 

I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked 
round; there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth 
showed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany 
furniture: it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing- 
room at Gateshead, but comfortable enough. I was puzzling to make out 
the subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an indi- 
vidual carrying a light entered; another followed close behind. 

The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and 
large forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her counten- 
ance was grave, her bearing erect. 

“The child is very young to be sent alone,” said she, putting her 
candle down on the table. She considered me attentively for a minute 
or two, then further added,— 

“She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired. Are you tired?” 
she asked, placing her hand on my shoulder. 

“A little, ma’am.” 

“And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes 
to bed, Miss Miller. Is this the first time you have left your parents to 
come to school, my little girl?” 

I explained to her that I had no parents. She inquired how long they 
had been dead; then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could 
read, write, and sew a little; then she touched my cheek gently with her 
forefinger, and saying, “She hoped I should be a good child,” dismissed 
me along with Miss Miller. 

The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went 
with me appeared some years younger. The first impressed me by her 
voice, loox, and air. Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complex- 
ion, though of a careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like 
one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked indeed, 
what I afterwards found she really was, an under-leacher. Led by her, 
I passed from compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, 
of a large and irregular building; till, emerging from the total and some- 
what dreary silence pervading that portion of the house we had trav- 


34 JANE EYRE 


ersed, we came upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a 
wide, long room, with great deal tables two at each end, on cach of 
which burned a pair of candles, and seated all round on benches a con- 
gregation of girls of every age, from nine or ten to twenty. Seen by the 
dim light of the dips, their number to me appeared countless, though 
not in reality exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown 
stulf frocks of quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores. It was the 
hour of study; they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow’s 
task, and the hum I had heard was the combined result of their whisper- 
ed repetitions. 

Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking 
up to the Lop of the long room she cried out,— 

“Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!” 

Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered 
the books and removed them. Miss Miller again gave the word of com- 
mand,— 

“Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!” 

The fall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, 
with portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a 
pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray. The portions were 
handed round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug 
being common to all. When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was 
thirsty, but did not touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me 
incapable of eating: I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake 
shared into fragments, 

The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes 
filed off, two and two, upstairs, Overpowered by this time with weari- 
ness, I scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except 
that, like the school-room, I saw it was very Jong, To-night I was to be 
Miss Miller’s bedfellow; she helped me to undress. When laid down I 
glanced at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with 
two occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and 
amidst silence and complete darkness I fell asleep. 

The night passed rapidly: I was too tired even to dream; I only once 
awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in tor- 
rents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my 
side. When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls 
were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn and a rushlight 
or two burned in the room. I too rose reluctantly; it was bitier cold, 
and I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there 
was a basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one 
basin to six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room, Again the 


JANE EYRE 35 


bell rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended 
the stairs and entered the cold and dimly-lit schoolroom, Here prayers 
were read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out,— 

“Form classes!” 

A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller 
repeatedly exclaimed, “Silence!” and “Order!” When it subsided, I saw 
them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the 
four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a Bible, 
lay on each table, before the vacant seat. A pause of some seconds suc- 
ceeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss Miller walked 
from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound. 

A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, 
each walked to a table and took her seat; Miss Miller assumed the 
fourth vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which 
the smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was 
called, and placed at the bottom of it. 

Business now began: the day’s Collect was repeated, then certain 
texts of Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted read- 
ing of chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour. By the time that 
exercise was terminated, day had fully dawned. The indefatigable bell 
now sounded for the fourth time; the classes were marshalled and 
marched into another room to breakfast. How glad I was to behold a 
prospect of getting something to eat! I was now nearly sick from in- 
anition, having taken so little the day before. 

The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room. On two long 
tables smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, 
sent forth an odour far from inviting. I saw a universal manifestation 
of discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those 
destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of 
the first class, rose the whispered words,— 

“Disgusting! The porridge is burnt again 

“Silence!” ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the 
upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of 
somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table, 
while a more buxom lady presided at the other. 1 looked in vain for her 
I had first seen the night before; she was not visible. Miss Miller oc- 
cupied the foot of the table where I sat; and a strange, foreign-looking, 
elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found, took the corre- 
sponding seat at the other board. A long grace was said and a hymn 
sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and the meal 
began. 

Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my 


y>? 


36 JANE EYRE 


portion without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger 
blunted, I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess: burnt porridge 
is almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it. 
The spoons were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try 
to swallow it; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished. Break- 
fast was over, and none had breakfasted. Thanks being returned for 
what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was 
evacuated for the schoolroom. I was one of the last to go out, and in 
passing the tables I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and 
taste it; she looked at the others; all their countenances expressed dis~ 
pleasure, and one of them, the stout one, whispered,— 

“Abominable stuff! How shameful!” 

A. quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which 
the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it 
seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their 
privilege. The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and 
all abused roundly. Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had, 
Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls 
standing about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures. I heard the 
name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss 
Miller shook her head disapprovingly, bul she made no great effort to 
check the general wrath—doublless she shared in it. 

A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and 
standing in the middle of the room, cried,— 

“Silence! To your seats!” 

Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was re- 
solved into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of 
tongues. The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts; but 
still, all seemed to wait. Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, 
the eighty girls sat motionless arid erect: a quaint assemblage they ap- 
peared, all with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; 
in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about 
the throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a High- 
lander’s purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the 
purpose of a work-bag; all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country- 
made shoes, fastened with brass buckles. About twenty of those clad in 
this costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited 
them ill, and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest. 

I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the teach- 
ers~—none of them precisely pleased me, for the stout one was a little 
coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and grotesque, 
and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten, and over- 


JANE EYRE 37 


worked—when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole school 
rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring. 

What was the matter? I had heard no order given; I was puzzled. 
Ere I had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated; but as all 
eyes were now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction 
and encountered the personage who had received me last night. She 
stood at the bottom of the long room, on the hearth—for there was a 
fire at each end—she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely. 
Miss Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having re- 
ceived her answer, went back to her place, and said aloud,— 

“Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!” 

While the direclion was being executed, the lady consulted moved 
slowly up the room. I suppose I have a considerable organ of vener-~ 
ation, for I retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes 
traced her steps. Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and 
shapely; brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine 
pencilling of long lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; 
on each of her temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in 
round cutls, according to the fashion of those times, when neither 
smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue;. her dress, also in the 
mode of the day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish 
trimming of black velvet; a gold watch (watches were not so common 
{hen as now) shone at her girdle, Let the reader add, to complete the 
picture, refined features, a complexion, if pale, clear, and a stately air 
and carriage, and he will have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a 
correct idea of the exterior of Miss Temple—Maria Temple, as I after- 
wards saw the name written in a prayer-book entrusted to me to carry 
to church. 

The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken 
her seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned 
the first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson in geography. 
The lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history, 
grammar, etc., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded; 
and music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls. 
The duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last 
struck twelve. The superintendent rose, 

“T have a word to address to the pupils,” said she. 

The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but 
it sank at her voice. She went on,— 

“You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must 
be hungry:—I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be 
served to all.” 


38 JANE EYRE 


The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise. 

“Tt is to be done on my responsibility,” she added, in an explanatory 
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room. 

The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the 
high delight and refreshment of the whole school. The order was now 
given “To the garden!” Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings 
of coloured calico, and a cloak of gray frieze. I was similarly equipped, 
and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air. 

The garden was a wide enclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to 
exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered veranda ran down one 
side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of 
little beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils Lo cul- 
tivate, and each bed had an owner. When full of flowers they would 
doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was 
wintry blight and brown decay. I shuddered as I stood and looked 
round me. It was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively 
rainy, but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still 
soaking wet with the floods of yesterday. The stronger among the girls 
ran about and engaged in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones 
herded together for shelter and warmth in the veranda; and amongst 
these, as the dense mist penctrated to their shivering frames, I heard fre~ 
quently the sound of a hollow cough. 

As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice 
of me. I stood lonely enough; but to that feeling of isolation I was ac- 
customed—it did not oppress mc much. I leant against a pillar of the 
veranda, drew my gray mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the 
cold which nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnaw- 
ed me within, delivered myself up to the employment of watching and 
thinking. My reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit 
record. I hardly yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life 
seemed floated away to an immeasurable distance; the present was 
vague and strange, and of the future I could form no conjecture, I 
looked round the convent-like garden, and then up at the house—a large 
building, half of which seemed gray and old, the other half quite new. 
The new part, containing the schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by 
mullioned and latticed windows, which gave it a churchlike aspect; a 
stone tablet over the door bore this inscription:-— 

‘“Lowood Institution——-This portion was rebuilt ap-—, by Naomi 
Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Fall, in this county.” “Let your light 
so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify 
your Father which is in heaven.”—St, Matt. v. 16. 

I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation be- 


JANE EYRE 39 


longed to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import. I was 
still pondering the signification of “Institution,” and endeavouring to 
make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scrip- 
ture, when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my 
head. I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a 
book, on the perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood 
I could see the title—it was Rasselas; a name that struck me as strange, 
and consequently attractive. In turning a leaf she happened to look up, 
and I said to her directly,-— 

"Is your book interesting?” I had already formed the intention of 
asking her to lend it to me some day. 

“T like it,” she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during 
which she examined me. 

“What is it about?” I continued. I hardly know where I found the 
hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger—the step was 
contrary Lo my nature and habits—but I think her occupation touched 
a chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of 
a frivolous and childish kind—I could not digest or comprehend the 
serious or substantial. 

“You may look at it,” replied the girl, offering me the book. 

I did so. A brief examination convinced me that the contents were 
less taking than the title: Rasselas looked dull to my trifling taste; I 
saw nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed 
spread over the closely-printed pages. I returned it to her. She re- 
ceived it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse 
into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her— 

“Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means? 
What is Lowood Institution?” 

“This house where you are come to live.” 

“And why do they call it Institution? Is it in any way different from 
other schools?” 

“Tt is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are 
charity-children. I suppose you are an orphan: is not either your father 
or your mother dead?” 

“Both died before I can remember.” 

“Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this 
called an institution for educating orphans.” 

‘Do we pay no money? Do they keep us for nothing?” 

“We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each.” 

“Then why do they call us charity-children?” . 

“Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and 
the deficiency is supplied by subscription.”

“Who subscribes?” 

“Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neigh- 
bourhood and in London.” 

“Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?” 

“The lady who built the new part of this house, as that tablet records, 
and whose son overlooks and directs everything here,” 

“Why?” 

“Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment.” 

“Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, 
and who said we were to have some bread and cheese?” 

“To Miss Temple? Oh, no! I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr. 
Brocklehurst for all she does. Mr, Brocklehurst buys all our food and 
all our clothes.” 

“Does he Jive here?” 

“No—two miles off, at a large hall.” 

“Ts he a good man?” 

“He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good.” 

“Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?” 

Vag”? 

“And what are the other teachers called?” 

“The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the 
work, and cuts out—for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelis- 
ses, and everything. The little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; 
she teaches history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions. 
And the one who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to 
her side with a yellow riband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, 
in France, and teaches French.” 

*Do you like the teachers?” 

“Well enough,” 

“Do you like the little black one, and the Madame——~?—-I cannot 
pronounce her name as you do.” 

“Miss Scatcherd is hasty—you must take care not to offend her: 
Madame Pierrot is not a bad sort of person.” 

“But Miss Temple is the best—isn’t she?” 

“Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, 
because she knows far more than they do.” 

“Efave you been long here?” 

Two years.” 

“Are you an orphan?” 

“My mother is dead.” 

“Are you happy here?” 

“You ask rather too many questions. I have given you answers enough 
for the present; now I want to read.” 


JANE EYRE Al 


But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered 
the house. The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more 
appetizing than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the 
dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong 
steam redolent of rancid fat. I found the mess to consist of indifferent 
potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together. 
Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to 
each pupil. I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether 
every day’s fare would be like this. 

After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons 
recommenced, and were continued till five o’clock. 

The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with 
whom I had conversed in the veranda dismissed in disgrace by Miss 
Scatcherd from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the 
large schoalroom, The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ig- 
nominious, especially for so great a girl—she looked thirteen or up- 
wards. I expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; 
but to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though 
grave, she stood, the central mark of all eyes. “How can she bear it so 
quietly—so firmly?” I asked of myself. “Were I in her place, it seems 
to me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up. She looks 
as if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment—beyond 
her situation—of something not round her nor before her. I have heard 
of day-dreams—is she in a day-dream now? Her eyes are fixed on the 
floor, but I am sure they do not see it—her sight seems turned in, gone 
down into her heart: she is looking at what she can remember, I be- 
lieve; not at what is really present. I wonder what sort of a girl she is 
—whether good or naughty.” 

Soon after 5 p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of 
coffee, and half a slice of brown bread. I devoured my bread and drank 
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more—I 
was still hungry. Half an hour’s recreation succeeded, then study; then 
the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed. Such 
was my first day at Lowood. 


CHAPTER VI 


THE next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rush- 
light; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony 
of washing—the water in the pitchers was froze1. A change had taken 
place in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind, 


42 JANE EYRE 


whistling th.ough the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long. 
had made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers 
to ice. 

Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was 
over, I felt ready to perish with cold, Breakfast-time came at last, and 
this morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the 
quantily small. How small my portion seemed! I wished it had been 
doubled. 

In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, 
and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto I had 
only been a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to be- 
come an actor therein, At first, being little accustomed to learn by 
heart, the Jessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent 
change from task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, 
about three o’clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a 
border of muslin two yards long, together with needle, thimble, etc., 
and sent me to sil in a quict corner of the schoolroom, with directions to 
hem the same, At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; 
but one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd’s chair reading, and as all 
was quiet, the subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the 
manner in which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or 
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance. It was English 
history. Among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the veranda: 
at the commencement of the Iegson, her place had been at the top of 
the class, but. for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to 
stops, she was suddenly sent to the very bottom. Even in that obscure 
position, Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant 
notice; she was continually addressing to her such phrases as the fol- 
lowing :-——~ 

“Burns” (such, it seems, was her name: the girls here were all called 
by their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), “Burns, you are standing on 
the side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately.” “Burns, you 
poke your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in.” “Burns, I insist on your 
holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,” 
etc., etc, 

A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and 
the girls examined. The lesson had comprised part of the reign of 
Charles I, and there were sundry questions about tonnage and pound- 
age and ship-money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; 
still, every little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: 
her memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, 
and she was ready with answers on every point. I kept expecting that 


JANE EYRE 43 


Miss Scatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead of that, she sud~ 
denly cried out,— 

“Vou dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this 
morning!” 

Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence. 

“Why,” thought I, “does she not explain that she could neither clean 
her nails nor wash her face, as the water was frozen?” 

My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a 
skein of thread. While she was winding it, she talked to me from time 
to time, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I 
could mark, stitch, knit, etc.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue 
my observations on Miss Scatcherd’s movements, When I returned to 
my seat, that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch 
the import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the 
small inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, 
carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end, This 
ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtsy; 
then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the 
teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with 
the bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to Burns’s eye; and, while I paused 
from my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a 
sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pen- 
sive face altered its ordinary expression, 

“Hardened girl!” exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; “nothing can correct 
you of your slatternly habits: carry the rod away.” 

Burns obeyed. I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the 
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket, 
and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek. 

The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the 
day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five 
o’clock had revived vitality, if it had mot satisfied hunger; the long 
restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than 
in the morning—its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to 
supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the 
ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave 
one a welcome sense of liberty. 

On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog 
her pupil Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and 
lJanghing groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when T 
passed the windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it, 
snowed fasi, a drift was already forming against the lower panes; put- 


44 JANE EYRE 


ting my ear close to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful 
tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind outside. 

Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this 
would have been the hour when J should most keenly have regretted the 
Separation: that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure 
chaos would have disturbed my peace: as it was, I derived from both a 
strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl 
more wildly, the gloom to decpen to darkness, and the confusion to rise 
to clamour, 

Jumping over forms and creeping under tables, I made my way to one 
of the fire-places; there, knecling by the high wire fender, I found 
Burns, absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the compan- 
jonship of a book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers. 

“Ts it still Rasselas?” I asked, coming behind her. 

“Ves,” she said: “and I have just finished it.” 

And in five minutes more she shut it up. I was glad of this. 

“Now,” thought I, “I can perhaps get her to talk.’ I sat down by her 
on the floor. 

“What is your name besides Burns?” 

“Helen.” 

“Da you come a long way from here?” 

“T come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scot- 
land.” 

“Will you ever go back?” 

“T hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future.” 

“You must wish to leave Lowood?” 

“No! why should I? I was sent Lo Lowood to get an education; and 
it would be of no use going away until I have attaincd that object.” 

“But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?” 

“Cruel? Not at all! She is severe; she dislikes my faults.” 

“And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her, 
Tf she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should 
break it under her nose,” 

“Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr. 
Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great 
grief to your relations. It is far better to endure patiently a smart which 
nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil 
consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the 
Bible bids us return good for evil,” 

“But then it seems disgraceful to be fogged, and to be sent to stand 
‘in the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I 
am far younger than you, and I could not bear it.” 


JANE EYRE 45 


“Vet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is 
weak and silly to say you cannot bear what it is your fate to be required 
to bear.” 

J heard her with wonder: T could not comprehend this doctrine of 
endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathize with the for- 
bearance she expressed for her chastiser. Still I felt that Helen Burns 
considered things by a light invisible to my eyes. I suspected she might 
be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply: like 
Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season. 

“You say you have faults, Helen: what are they? To me you seem 
very good.” 

“Then learn from me not to judge by appearance. I am, as Miss 
Scatcherd says, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things in 
order; I am careless; I forget rules; I read when T should learn my les- 
sons; I have no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot bear to 
be subjected to systematic arrangements, This is all very provoking to 
Miss Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular.” 

“And cross and cruel,” I added, Bat Helen Burns would not admit my 
addition; she kept silence. 

“Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?” 

At the utterance of Miss Temple’s name, a soft smile flitted over her 
grave face. 

“Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one, 
even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them 
gently; and if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed 
liberally. One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that 
even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure 
me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly, 
cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight.” 

“That is curious,” said I; “it is s0 easy to be careful.” 

“For you I have no doubt it is, I observed you in your class this 
morning, and saw you were closely attentive; your thoughts never 
seemed to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and ques- 
tioned you. Now, mine continually rove away: when I should be listen- 
ing to Miss Scatcherd, and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I 
lose the very sound of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream. Sometimes 
I think I am in Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me 
are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through Deepden, near our 
house;—then, when it comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awak- 
ened; and having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the 
visionary brook, I have no answer ready,” 

“Yet how well you replied this afternoon.” 


46 JANE EYRE 


“Tt was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had 
interested me. This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, T was 
wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and 
unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought whai a pity 
it was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no 
farther than the prerogatives of the crown. If he had but been able to 
look to a distance, and sec how what they call the spirit of the age was 
tending! Still, I like Charles—I respect him—I pity him, poor mur- 
dered king! Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had 
no right to shed. How dared they kill him!” 

Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very 
well understand her-—that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject 
she discussed. I recalled her to my level, 

“And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander 
then?” 

“No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally some- 
thing to say which is newer than my own reflections: her language is 
singularly agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is 
often just what I wished to gain.” 

“Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?” 

“Ves, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination 
guides me, There is no merit in such goodness.” 

“A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you, It is all I 
ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who 
are crucl and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: 
they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter; but would 
grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we 
should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should—so hard as to 
teach the person who struck us never to do it again.” 

“You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older; as yet, you 
are but a little untaught girl.” 

“But I feel this, Helen: I must dislike those who, whatever I do to 
please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me 
unjustly, If is as natural as that I should love those who show me af- 
fection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved.” 

“Fleathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and 
civilized nations disown it.” 

“How? I don’t understand.” 

*Tt is not violence that best overcomes hate-—nor vengeatice that most 
certainly heals injury.” 

“What then?” 


JANE EVRE 47 


“Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how 
He acts; make His word your rule, and His conduct your example.” 

“What does He say?” 

“Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that 
hate you and despitefully use you.” 

“Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I Fannot do; I should bless her 
son John, which is impossible.” 

In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forth- 
with to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resent- 

*ments. Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without re- 
serve or softening. 

Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make 
a remark, but she said nothing. 

“Well,” I asked impatiently, “is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad 
woman?” 

“She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes 
your cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine: but how minutely 
you remember all she has done and said to you! What a singularly deep 
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart! No ill. 
usage so brands its record on my feelings. Would you not be happier if 
you tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions 
it excited? Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity 
or registering wrongs, We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with 
faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall 
put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and 
sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the 
spark of the spirit will remain—the impalpable principle of life and 
thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence 
it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being 
higher than man—perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the 
pale human soul to brighten to the seraph! Surcly it will never, on the 
contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend? No; I cannot be- 
lieve that, I hold another creed, which no one ever taught me, and which 
I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for it ex- 
tends hope to all; it makes Eternity a rest—a mighty home, not a terror 
and an abyss. Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly distinguish be- 
tween the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely forgive the first 
while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never worrics my heart, 
degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never crushes me too 
low: I live in calm, looking to the end.” 

Helen’s head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this 
sentence. I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but 


48 JANE EYRE 


rather to converse with her own thoughts. She was not allowed muck 
time for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up 
exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent,— 

“Helen Burns, if you don’t go and put your drawer in order, and fold 
up your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at 
itl” 

Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor 
without reply as without delay, 


CHAPTER VII 


My first quarter at Lowood scemed an age; and not the golden age 
either: it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating 
myself to new rules and unwonted tasks. The fear of failure in these 
points harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though 
these were no trifles. 

During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, 
after their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring 
beyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits 
we had to pass an hour every day in the open air. Our clothing was in- 
sufficient to protect us from the severe cold; we had no boots, the snow 
got into our shoes and melted there; our ungloved hands became 
numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well 
the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when 
my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff 
toes into my shoes in the morning, Then the scanty supply of food was 
distressing: with the keen appetiles of growing children, we had scarce- 
ly sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid. From this deficiency of 
nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger 
pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they 
would coax or menace the little ones out of their portion, Many a time 
I have shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown 
bread distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing, to a third, half 
the contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with 
an accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of 
hunger. 

Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season, We had to walk two 
tiles to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated, We set out 
cold, we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became 
almost paralyzed. It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance 


JANE EYRE 49 
1 


of cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in 
our ordinary meals, was served round between the services. 

At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and 
hilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy 
summits to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces. 

I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our 
drooping line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered 
close about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up 
our spirits, and march forward, as she said, “like stalwart soldiers.” 
The other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much de- 
jected to altempt the task of cheering others. 

How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got 
back! But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in 
the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great 
girls, and behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrap- 
ping their starved arms in their pinafores. 

A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of 
bread—a whole, instead of a half, slice—with the delicious addition of a 
thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we al} 
looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath. I generally contrived to re. 
serve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder 
was invariably obliged to part with. 

The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church 
Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; 
and in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepres- 
sible yawns attested her weariness. A frequent interlude of these per- 
formances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half- 
dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if 
not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half 
dead. The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the 
schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished. 
Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; 
they were then propped up with the monitors’ high stools, 

I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed 
that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month 
after my arrival—perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the arch- 
deacon: his absence was a relief to me. I need not say that I had my 
own reasons for dreading his coming; but come he did at last. 

One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was 
sitting with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my 
eyes, raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just 
passing: I recognized almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when, 


50 JANE EYRE 


two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose e masse, it was 
not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance 
they thus greeted. A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently 
beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column 
which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gates- 
head. I now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture. Yes, I was 
right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking 
longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever. 

T had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition: too well 
T remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposi- 
tion, etc.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss 
Temple and the teachers of my vicious nature. All along T had been 
dreading the fulfilment of this promise,—I had been looking out daily 
for the “Coming Man,” whose information respecting my past life and 
conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was. 

He stood at Miss Temple’s side; he was speaking low in her ear, I 
did not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and 1 watched 
her eye with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to sec its dark orb 
turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt. I listened too; and as 
I happened to be seated quiie at the top of the room, I caught most of 
what was said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension. 

“I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it 
struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, 
and I sorted the needles to match. You may tell Miss Smith that I for- 
got to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have 
Some papers sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, 10 give 
out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are 
apt to be careless and lose them. And oh, ma’am, I wish the woollen 
stockings were better looked to! When I was here last, I went into the 
kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was 
a quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of 
the holes in them I was sure they had not been well mended from time 
to time,” : 

He paused. 

“Your directions shall be attended to, sir,” said Miss Temple, 

“And, ma’am,” he continued, “the laundresg tells me some of the girls 
have two clean Luckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them 
to one.” . 

“YT think I can explain that circumstance, sir. Agnes and Catherine 
Johnstone were inviled to take tea with some friends at Lowton last 
Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the occa+ 
sion. 


JANE EYRE 51 


Mr. Brocklehurst nodded. 

-“Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance 
occur too often. And there is another thing which surprised me: I find, 
in settling accounts with the housckeeper, that a lunch, consisting of 
bread and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past 
fortnight. How is this? I looked over the regulations, and I find no such 
meal as lunch mentioned. Who introduced this innovation? and by what 
authority?” 

“T must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,” replied Miss 
Temple: “the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not 
possibly eat it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner- 
time.” 

“Madam, allow me an instant. You are aware that my plan in bring- 
ing up these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and in- 
dulgence, but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying. Should any 
little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoil- 
ing of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought 
not to be neutralized by replacing with something more delicate the 
comfort lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this in- 
stitution; it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the 
pupils, by encouraging them to evince fortitude under the temporary 
privation. A brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed, 
‘wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to 
the sufferings of the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; 
to the exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His dis- 
ciples to take up their cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man 
shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of 
the mouth of God; to His divine consolations, ‘If ye suffer hunger or 
thirst for My sake, happy are ye,’ Oh, madam, when you put bread and 
cheese, instead of burnt porridge, into these children’s mouths, you may - 
indeed feed their vile bodies, but you little think how you starve their 
immortal souls!” 

Mr. Brocklehurst again paused—perhaps, overcome by his feelings. 
Miss Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but 
she now gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as 
marble, appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that 
material—especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a 
sculptor’s chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified 
severity. 

Meantime, Mr, Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands 
behind his back, majestically surveyed the whole school. Suddenly his 
eye gave a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or 


52 JANE EVRE 


shocked its pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had 
hitherto used,— 

“Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what—w/haz is that girl with curled hair? 
—red hair, ma’am, curled—curled all over?” And extending his cane he 
pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so. 

“It is Julia Severn,” replied Miss Temple, very quietly. 

“Julia Severn, ma’am! And why has she, or any other, curled hair? 
Why, in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she 
conform to the world so openly—here in an evangelical, charilable es- 
tablishkment—as to wear her hair one mass of curls?” 

“Julia’s hair curls naturally,’ returned Miss Temple, still more 
quietly. 

“Naturally! Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these 
girls Lo be the children of Grace: and why that abundance? I have again 
and again intimated that I desire the hair 10 be arranged closely, mod. 
estly, plainly. Miss Temple, that girl’s hair must be cut off entirely; I 
will send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much 
of the excrescence—that fall girl, tell her to turn round. Tell all the 
first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall.” 

Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if 1o smooth 
away the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, how- 
ever, and when the first class could take in whal was required of them; 
they obeyed. Leaning a little back on my bench, J could see the looks 
and grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre, It was a 
pity Mr. Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have 
felt that, whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, 
the inside was further beyond his inlerference than he imagined. 

He scrutinized the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, 
then pronounced sentence. These words fell like the knell of doom,-—~ 

“All those top-knots must be cut off.” 

Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate. 

“Madam,” he pursued, “I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is 
sot of this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the 
Mesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shamefacedness and sob- 
tiety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young 
bersons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity 
itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off: think of the 
time wasted, of 4 

Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted; three other visitors, ladies, 
now entered the room. They ought to have come a little sooner to have 
heard his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk, 
and furs. The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and seven- 


JANE EYRE 53 


teen) had gray beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich plumes, 
and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of 
light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was enveloped in a costly 
velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a false front of French 
curls, 

These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs and 
the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of 
the room, It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend 
telative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the rooms 
upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned 
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent. They now proceeded to 
address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged 
with the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I 
had no time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and 
enchained my attention. 

Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and 
Miss Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to 
secure my personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could 
only elude observation. To this end, I had sat well back on the form, 
and while seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a 
manner as to conceal my face. I might have escaped notice, had not my 
treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling 
with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me, I knew it 
was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of 
slate, I rallied my forces for the worst. It came. 

“A careless girl!” said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after— 
“It is the new pupil, I perceive.” And before I could draw breath, “T 
must not forget I have a word to say respecting her.” Then aloud—how 
loud it seemed to me!—'‘Let the child who broke her slate come for- 
ward!” 

Of my own accord I could not have stirred—I was paralyzed; but the 
two great girls who sat on each side of me set me on my legs and pushed 
me towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me 
to his very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel,— 

“Don’t be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be 
punished,” 

The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger. 

“Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite,” thought 
I; and an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded 
in my pulses at the conviction. I was no Helen Burns, 

“Fetch that stool,” said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one - 
from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought, 


54 JANE EYRE 


“Place the child upon it.” 

And I was placed there, by whom I don’t know: I was in no condi- 
tion to note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up 
to the height of Mr. Brocklehurst’s nose, that he was within a yard of 
me, and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a 
cloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me. 

Mr. Brocklehursl hemmed. 

“Ladies,” said he, turning to his family, “Miss Temple, teachers, and 
children, you all see this girl?” 

Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses 
agains. my scorched skin. 

“Vou see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary 
form of childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has 
given to all of us; no signal deformity points her oul as a marked char- 
acter. Who would think that the Evil One had already found a servant 
and agent in her? Yet such, I gricve to say, is the case.” 

A pause—in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to 
feel that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be 
shirked, must be firmly sustained. 

“My dear children,” pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos, 
“this is a sad, melancholy occasion; for il becomes my duty to warn you 
that this girl, who might be one of God’s own lambs, is a little cast- 
away—nol a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and 
an alien. You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her 
example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports, 
and shut her out from your converse, Teachers, you must watch her: 
keep your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinize her 
actions, punish her hody to save her soul—if, indeed, such salvation be 
possible, for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the 
native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says 
its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggerndut—this girl is—a 
liar 1” 

Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in 
perfect possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklchursts 
produce their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while 
the elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones 
whispered, “How shocking!” 

Mr, Brocklehurst resumed :— 

“This I learned from her benefactress—from the pious and charitable 
lady who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daugh- 
ter, and whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an, 
ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was 


JANE EYRE 55 


obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious 
example should contaminate their purity. She has sent her here to be 
healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool of 
Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the 
waters to stagnate round her.” 

With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top but- 
ton of his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed 
to Miss Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the 
room, Turning at the door, my judge said,— 

“Let her stand half an hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak 
to her during the remainder of the day.” 

There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear 
the shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was 
now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy. What my sensa- 
tions were no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling 
my breath and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in 
passing, she lifted her eyes, What a strange light inspired them! What 
an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me! How the new feel- 
ing bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or 
victim, and imparted strength in the transit. I mastered the rising 
hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool. Helen 
Burns asked some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was 
chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and 
smiled at me as she again went by. What a smile! I remember it now, 
and I know that it was the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it 
lit up her marked lineaments, her thin face, her sunken gray eye, like a 
reflection from the aspect of an angel. Yet at that moment Helen Burns 
wore on her arm “the untidy badge;” scarcely an hour ago I had heard 
her condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on 
the morrow, because she had blotted an exercise in copying it out, Such 
is the imperfect nature of man; such spots are there on the disc of the 
clearest planet; and eyes like Miss Scatcherd’s can only see those mi- 
nute defects, and are blind to the full brightness of the orb! 


CHAPTER VIII 


Ere& the half-hour ended, five o’clock struck; school was dismissed, and 
all were gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to descend. It 
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner, and sat down on the floor. The 
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction 


56 JANE EYRE 


took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I 
sank prostrate with my face to cne ground. Now I wept: Helen Burns 
was not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, 
and my tears watered the boards. I had meant to be so good, and to do 
so much at Lowood—lo make so many friends, to earn respect and win 
affection. Already I had made visible progress. That very morning I 
had reached the head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; 
Miss Temple had smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me 
drawing, and to let me learn French, if I continued to make similar im- 
provement two months longer. And then I was well received by my 
fellow-pupils; treated as an equal by those of my own age, and not 
molested by any. Now, here I lay again crushed and trodden on; and 
could I ever rise more? 

“Never,” I thought; and ardently I wished to dic. While sobbing out 
this wish in broken accents, some one approached. I started up—again 
Helen Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up 
the long, vacant room: she brought my coffee and bread. 

“Come, eat something,” said she; but I put both away from me, feel- 
ing as if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condi- 
tion. Helen regarded me, probably, with surprise: I could not now abate 
my agitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud. She sat 
down on the ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and 
rested her head upon them; in that altitude she remained silent as an 
Indian, I was the first who spoke. 

“Flelen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a 
liar?” 

“Everybody, Jane? Why, there are only eighty people who have 
heard you called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions,” 

“But what have I to do with millions? The eighty, I know, despise 
me.” 

“Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either 
despises or dislikes you; many, I am sure, pity you much. 

“Flow can they pity me after what Mr, Brocklehurst has saidP” 

“Mr, Brocklehurst is not a god; nor is he even a great and admired 
man: he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked. 
Had he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found 
enemies, declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number 
would offer you sympathy if they dared. Teachers and pupils may look 
coldly on you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in 
their hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere 
long appear so much the more evident for their temporary suppression, 
Besides, Jane”—she pansed. 


JANE EYRE 57 


“Well, Helen?” said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my 
fingers gently to warm them, and went on,— 

“Tf all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own 
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not 
be without friends.” 

“No; I know I should think well of myself. But that is not enough: 
if others don’t love me, I would rather die than live—I cannot bear to 
be solitary and hated, Helen. Look here: to gain some real affection 
from you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would 
willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull 
toss me, or to stand behind a kicking horse and Ict it dash its hoof at my 
chest: n 

“Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you 
are too impulsive, too vehement: the sovereign hand that created your 
frame, and put life into it, has provided you with other resources than 
your feeble self, or than creatures feeble as you. Besides this earth, and 
besides the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of 
spirits: that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits 
watch us, for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying 
in pain and shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, 
angels see our tortures, recognize our innocence (if innocent we be—as 
I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and 
pompously repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sin- 
cere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits 
only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward. 
Why, then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is 
so soon over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness—to 
glory?” 

I was silent: Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she im- 
parted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness. I felt the impres~ 
sion of woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, 
having done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short 
cough, I momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern 
for her. 

Resting my head on Helen’s shoulder, I put my arms round her 
waist; she drew me to her, and we reposed in silence. We had not sat 
long thus, when another person came in. Some heavy clouds swept 
from the sky by a rising wind had left the moon bare, and her light, 
streaming in through a window near, shone full both on us and on the 
approaching figure, which we at once recognized as Miss Temple. 

“I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,” said she. “I want you in 
my room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too.” 


58 JANE EYRE 


We went. Following the superintendent’s guidance, we had to thread 
some intricate passages, and mount a staircase, before we reached her 
apartment; it contained a good five, and looked cheerful. Miss Temple 
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the 
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side. 

“Ts it all over?” she asked, looking down at my face. “Have you 
cried your grief away?” 

“T am afraid I never shall do that.” 

“Why?” 

“Because [ have been wrongly accused; and you, ma’am, and every- 
body else, will now think me wicked.” 

“We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child, Con- 
tinue to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us.” 

“Shall I, Miss Temple?” 

“Vou will,” said she, passing her arm round me, “And now tell me 
who is' the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?” 

“Mrs, Reed, my uncle’s wife, My uncle is dead, and he left me to her 
care,” 

“Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?” 

“No, ma’am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have 
often heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she 
would always keep me.’ 

“Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a 
criminal ig accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence, 
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as 
you can, Say whatever your memory suggests as true, but add nothing 
and exaggerate nothing.” 

I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate 
--most correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to ar- 
range coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad 
childhood. Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than 
it generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of 
Helen’s warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into 
the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary. Thus re- 
strained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as J went on 
that Miss Temple fully believed me. 

In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come 
to see me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode 
of the red-room; in detailing which my excitement was sure, in some 
degree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the 
spasm, of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my 


JANE EYRE 59 


wild supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark 
and haunted chamber. ; 

T had finished. Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; 
she then said,— 

“I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him: if his reply 
agrees with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every 
imputation; to me, Jane, you are clear now.” 

She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well con- 
tented to stand, for I derived a child’s pleasure from the contemplation 
of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white forehead, 
her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she proceeded 
to address Helen Burns. 

“How are you to-night, Helen? Have you coughed much to-day?” 

“Not quite so much, I think, ma’am.” 

“And the pain in your chest?” 

“Tt is a little better.” 

Miss Temple got up, took her hand, and examined her pulse; then she 
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low. She 
was pensive a few minutes; then rousing herself, she said cheerfully— 

“But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such.” 
She rang her bell. 

“Barbara,” she said to the servant who answered it, “I have not yet 
had tea; bring the tray, and place cups for these two young ladies.” 

And a tray was soon brought. How pretty, to my eyes, did the china 
cups and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the 
fire! How fragrant was the steam of the beverage and the scent of the 
toast! of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be 
hungry), discerned only a very small portion. Miss Temple discerned 
it too, 

“Barbara,” said she, “can you not bring a little more bread and but+ 
ter? There is not enough for three.” 

Barbara went out: she returned soon. 

“Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity.” 

Mrs, Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after 
Mr. Brocklehurst’s own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and 
iron. 

“Oh, very well!” retumed Miss Temple; “we must make it do, Bar- 
bara, I suppose.” And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, “For- 
tunately, I have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once.” 

Having invited Helen and me to approach the-table, and placed be- 
fore each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, 


60 JANE EYRE 


she got up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in 
paper, disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized secd-cake. 

“J meant to give each of you some of this to take with you,” said 
she; “but ag there is so little toast, you must have it now,” and she 
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand. 

We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least 
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which 
our hostess regarded us, as we salisfied our famished appetites on the 
delicate fare she liberally supplied. 

Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire, 
We sat on each side of her; and now a conversation followed between 
her and Helen, which it was indeed a privilege Lo be admitted to hear. 

Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in 
her mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded devia- 
tion into the ardent, the excited, the cager—something which chastened 
the pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a con- 
trolling sense of awe; and such was my fecling now: but as lo Helen 
Butns, I was struck with wonder. 

The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of 
her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in- 
her own unique mind, had roused her powers within her. They woke, 
they kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which 
till this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in 
the liquid Justre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty 
more singular than that of Miss Temple’s—a beauty neither of fine col- 
our nor Jong eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, 
of radiance. Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from 
what source T cannot tell. Has a gir] of fourteen a heart Jarge enough, 
vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid elo- 
quence? Such was the characteristic of Helen’s discourse on that, to 
me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a 
very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence. 

They conversed of things I had never heard of—of nations and times 
past; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed 
at: they spoke of books—how many they had read! What stores of 
knowledge they possessed! Then they scemed so familiar with French 
names and French authors. But my amazement reached its climax when 
Miss Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall 
the Latin her father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade 
her read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of 
veneration expanding at every sounding line. She had scarcely finished 


JANE EYRE 6f 


ere the bell announced bedtime’ no delay could be admitted; Miss 
Temple embraced us both, saying, as she drew us to her heart,— 

“God bless you, my children!” 

Helen she held a little longer than me; she let her go more reluctant- 
ly. It was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a 
second time breathed a sad sigh, for her she wiped a tear from her 
cheek. 

On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she 
was examining drawers, She had just pulled out Helen Burns’s; and 
when we entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told 
that tomorrow she should have half a dozen of untidily-folded articles 
pinned to her shoulder. 

“My things were indeed in shameful disorder,” murmured Helen to 
me, in a low voice: “I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.” 

Next morning Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on 4 
piece of pasteboard the word “Slattern,” and bound it like a phylactery 
round Helen’s large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead. She 
wore it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved pun- 
ishment. The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, 
I ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which 
she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot 
and large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of 
her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart. 

About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss 
Temple, who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared 
that what he said went to corroborate my account. Miss Temple, hav- 
ing assembled the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made 
into the charges alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy 
10 be able to pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation. 
The teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of 
pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions. 

Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh, 
resolved to pioncer my way through every difficulty. I toiled hard, and 
my success was proportionate to my efforts: my memory, not naturally 
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits: in a few 
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in Jess than two months I was 
allowed to commence French and drawing. J learned the first two tenses 
of the verb Hive, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the- 
bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa}, on the 
same day, That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in imagina~ 
tion the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread and 
new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I 


62 JANE EYRE 


feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the‘ 
dark; all the work of my own hands—frecly pencilled houses and trees, 
picluresque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweel paintings 
of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe 
cherries, of wrens’ nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with 
young ivy sprays. I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my 
ever being able io translate currently a certain litle French story which 
Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved 
to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep. 

Well has Solomon said, “Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, 
than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.” 

I would not now have exchanged Lowood, with all its privations, for 
Gateshead and its daily luxuries, 


CHAPTER Ix 


Bur the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened. Spring 
drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased; 
ils snows were melted, its culling winds ameliorated, My wretched feet, 
flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to 
heal and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and 
mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood 
in our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden; 
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a 
greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, sug- 
gested the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each 
morning brighter traces of her steps. Flowers peeped out amongst the 
leaves: snowdrops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies. 
On Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found 
still sweeter Mowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges. 

I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the 
horizon only bounded, Jay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls 
of our garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits 
girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, 
full of dark stones and sparkling eddies. How different had ihis scene 
looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiff- 
ened in frost, shrouded with snow!—-when mists as chill as death 
wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and 
rolled down “ing” and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the 
beck! That beck itself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless;: it tore 


JANE EVRE 63 


asunder the wocd, and sent a raving sound through the air, often thick- 
ened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, 
that showed only ranks of skeletons. 

April advanced to May: a bright, serene May it was; days of blue 
sky, placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its 
duration. And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook 
loose its tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and 
oak skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up 
profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its hollows, 
and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its wild 
primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed 
spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre. All this I enjoyed often and 
fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberly and 
pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to advert. 

Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it 
as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream? 
Assuredly, pleasant enough; but whether healthy or not, is another ques- 
tion. 

That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog- 
bred pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept 
into the Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded school- 
room and dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary 
{nto a hospital. 

Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the 
pupils to receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at 
one time. Classes were broken up, rules relaxed. The few who con- 
tinued well were allowed almost unlimited license, because the medical 
attendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in 
health: and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or re- 
strain them. Miss Temple’s whole attention was absorbed by the pa- 
tients; she lived in the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a 
few hours’ rest at night. The teachers were fully occupied with pack- 
ing up and making other necessary preparations for the departure of 
those girls who were fortunate enough to have friends and relations able 
and willing to remove them from the seat of contagion. Many, already 
smitten, went home only to die: some died at the school, and were buried 
quietly and quickly, the nature of the malady forbidding delay. 

While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death 
its frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; 

‘hile its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and 
the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effiuvia of mortality, that 
bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland 


64 JANE EYRE 


out of doors. Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had 
sprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; 
the borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson 
double daisies, the sweethriers gave out, morning and evening, their 
scent of spice and apples: and these fragrant treasures were all useless 
for most of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then 2 
handful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin, 

But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of 
the scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood like gipsies, from 
morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked. We lived 
better too. Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood 
now; houschold matters were not scrutinized into; the cross house- 
keeper was gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, 
who had been matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of 
her new abode, provided with comparative liberality. Besides, there 
were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were 
better filled. When there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which 
often happened, she would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick 
slice of bread and cheese; and this we carried away with us to the wood, 
where we each chose the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously. 

My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry 
from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading 
through the water, a feat I accomplished barefoot. The stone was just 
broad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at 
that time my chosen comrade—~one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, ob- 
servant personage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly because she 
was witty and original, and partly because she had a manner which set 
me at my ease. Some years older than I, she knew more of the world, 
and could tell me many things I liked to hear; with her my curiosity 
found gratification, To my faults also she gave ample indulgence, never 
imposing curb or rein on anything I said, She had a turn for narrative, 

I for analysis; she liked to inform, I to question: so we got on swim- 
mingly together, deriving much entertainment, if not much improve- 
ment, from our mutual intercourse. 

And where, meantime, was Helen Burns? Why did I not spend these 
sweet days of liberty with her? Had I forgotten her? or was I Sick, 
worthless as to have grown tired of her pure society? Surely the Marieng 
Ann Wilson I have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintancaft. 
she could only tell me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy aMygth 
pungent gossip I chose to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth onnd 
Helen, she was qualified to give those who enjoyed the privilege of heshe 
converse a taste of far higher things. ‘ore 

True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective 


JANE EYRE 65 


being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of 
Helen Burns, nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of attach- 
ment. as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated my 
heart. How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under 
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which 
ill-huniour never soured, nor irritation ever troubled? But Helen was ill 
at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I 
knew not what room upstairs. She was not, I was told, in the hospital 
portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was con- 
sumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance, under- 
stood something mild, which time and care would be sure to alleviate. 

I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming 
downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss 
Temple into the garden, But on these occasions I was not allowed to go 
and speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then 
not distinctly, for she was much wrapped up, and sat. at a distance under 
the veranda. 

One evening, in the begining of June, I had stayed out very late with 
Mary Ann in the wood. We had, as usual, separated ourselves from the 
others, and had wandered far—so far that we lost our way, and had to 
ask it al a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked 
after a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood. When 
we got back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the 
surgeon’s, was standing at the garden door. Mary Ann remarked that 
she supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for 
at that time of the evening. She went into the house; I stayed behind a 
few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in 
the forest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the morn- 
ing. This done, I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet 
as the dew fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the 
still glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the 
moon rose with such majesty in the grave east. I was noting these 
things and enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as 
it had never done before:— 

“How sad to be lying now on a sick-bed, and to he in danger of dy- 
ing! This world is pleasant,—it would be dreary to be called from it, 
and to have to go who knows where?” 

And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what 
had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first 
time it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each 
side, and before it, it saw all around an unfathomed gulf. It felt the one 
point where it stood—the present; all the rest was formless cloud and 
vacant depth: and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging 


66 JANE EYRE 


amid that chaos. While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door 
open: Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse. After she had 
scen him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, 
but I ran up Lo her. 

“How is Helen Burns?” 

“Very poorly,” was the answer. 

“Ts it her Mr. Bates has been to see?” 

“Yes.” 

“And what does he say about her?” 

“He says she'll not be here long.” 

This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only con. 
veyed the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, 
to her own home. I should not have suspected that it meunt she was 
dying; but I knew instantly now! It opened clear on my comprehension 
that Helen Burns was numbering her last days in this world, and that 
she was going to be taken to the region of spirits, if such region there 
were. I experienced a shock of horror; then a strong thrill of grief; then 
a desire~—a necessity to see her, and J asked in what room she Jay. 

“She is in Miss Temple’s room,” said the nurse, 

“May I go up and speak to her?” 

“Oh no, child! It is not likely. And now it is time for you to come 
in; you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling.” 

The nurse closed the front door; 1 went in by the side entrance which 
Jed to the schoolroom. I was just in time; it was nine o’clock, and Miss 
Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed. 

It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I—~not hav- 
ing been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the 
dormitory, that my companions were all wrap! in profound repose— 
rose softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, withou! shoes, 
crept from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple’s room. 
It was quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way, and the 
light of the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at pas- 
sage windows, cnabled me to find it without difficulty. An odour of 
camphor and burnt vinegar warned me when I came near the fever 
room; and I passed its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up 
all night should hear me. I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for 
I must see Helen,—I must embrace her before she diad,—I must give 
her one last kiss, exchange with her one last word. 

Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, 
and succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I 
reached another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just op- 
posite to me was Miss Temple’s room. A light shone through the key- 
hole and from under the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicin- 


JANE EYRE 67 


ity. Coming near, I found the door slightly ajar—probably to admit 
some fresh air into the close abode of sickness. Indisposed to hesitate, 
and full of impatient impulses—soul and senses quivering with keen 
throes—I put it back and looked in. My eye sought Helen, and feared 
to find death. 

Close by Miss Temple’s bed, and half covered with its white curtains, 
there stood a little crib. I saw the outline of a form under the clothes, 
but the face was hid by the hangings. The nurse I had spoken to in the 
garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt dimly on 
the table. Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards that she 
had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room. I advanced; 
then passed by the crib side; my hand was on the curtain, but I pre- 
ferred speaking before I withdrew it. I still recoiled at the dread of 
seeing a corpse. 

“Helen!” I whispered softly, “are you awake?” 

She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale, 
wasted, but quile composed: she looked so little changed that my fear 
was instantly dissipated. 

“Can it be you, Jane?” she asked, in her own gentle voice. 

“Qh!” I thought, “she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she 
could not speak and look so calmly if she were.” 

I got on to her crib and kissed her. Her forehead was cold, and her 
cheek both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she 
smiled as of old. 

“Why are you come here, Jane? It is past eleven o’clock—I heard it 
strike some minutes since.” 

“T came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not 
sleep till I had spoken to you.” 

“You come to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably.” 

“Are you going somewhere, Helen? Are you going home?” : 

“Ves; to my long home—my last home.” 

“No, no, Helen!” I stopped, distressed. While I tried to devour my 
tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the 
nurse. When it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she 
whispered, — 

“Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my 

uilt.” 
: I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her, After 
a long silence, she resumed, still whispering — 

“J am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you 
must be sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about. We all 
must die one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; 
it is gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest. I leave no one to regret me 


68 JANE EYRE 


much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss 
me. By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings. I had not qualities 
or talents to make my way very well in the world; I should have been 
continually at fault.” 

“But where are you going to, Helen? Can you sce? Do you know?” 

“T believe; I have faith: I am going to God.” 

“Where is God? What is God?” 

“My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created, I 
rely implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness. I 
count the hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to 
Him, reveal [lim to me,” 

“You are sure, then, Helen, thal there is such a place as heaven, and 
that our souls can get to it when we die?” 

“T am sune there is a future slate; I believe God is good; I can resign 
my immortal part to Him without any misgiving, God is my Father; 
God is my Friend: I love Him; 1 believe He loves me.” 

“And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?” 

“You will come to the same region of happiness—he received by the 
same mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane.” 

Again I questioned, but this time only in thought, “Where is that 
region? Does it exist?” And I clasped my arms closer round Helen: 
she seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; 
T lay with my face hidden on her neck. Presently she said, in the sweet- 
est. tone,-— 

“How comfortable I am! That last fit of coughing has tired me a 
little; I feel as if I could sleep. But don’t leave me, Jane; I like to have 
you near me,” 

“Tl stay with you, dear Helen; no one shall take me away.” 

“Are you warm, darling?” 

Vas,” 

“Good-night, Jane.” 

“Good-night, Helen.” 

She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered, 

When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me. I 
looked up: I was in somebody’s arms; the nurse held me; she was car~ 
rying me through the passage back to the dormitory. I was not repri- 
manded for leaving my bed—people had something else to think about; 
no explanation was afforded then to my many questions; bul a day or 
two afterwards I learned that Miss Temple, on returning to her own 
room at dawn, had found me laid in the little crib, ny face against 
Helen Burns’s shoulder, my arms round her neck, I was asleep, and 
Helen was—dead, 

Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard. For fifteen years after 


JANE EYRE 69 


her death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a gray 
marble tablet marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word 
“Resurgam,” 


CHAPTER X 


HirHerto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant exist- 
ence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many 
chapters. But this is not to be a regular autobiography: I am only 
bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some 
degrec of interest. Therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost 
in silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of con- 
nection. 

When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lo- 
wood, it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence 
and the number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school. 
Inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various 
facts came out which excited public indignation in a high degree. The 
‘ unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children’s 
food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils’ 
wretched clothing and accommodations-—~all these things were discov- 
ered, and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brockle- 
hurst, but beneficial to the institution. 

Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed 
largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better situa- 
tion; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing in- 
troduced; the funds of the school were entrusted to the management of 
a committee, Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family con- 
nections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of treasurer; 
but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen of rather 
more enlarged and sympathizing minds: his office of inspector, too, was 
shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness, com- 
fort with economy, compassion with uprightness. The school, thus im- 
proved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution. I remained 
an inmate of iis walls, after its regeneration, for eight years—six as 
pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my testimony to 
its value and importance. 

During these eight years my life was uniform; but not unhappy, be- 
cause it was not inactive. I had the means of an excellent education 
placed within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a de- 
sire to excel in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers 
especially such as I lovetl, urged me on. I availed myself fully of the 


vi JANE EVRE 


advantages offered me, In time I rose to be the first girl of the first 
class; then I was invested with the office of teacher, which I discharged 
with zeal for two years; but at the end of that time I altered. 

Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superin- 
tendent of the seminary. To her instruction I owed the best part of my 
acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace; 
she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly, com- 
panion. At this period she married, removed with her husband (a clergy- 
man, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant 
county, and consequently was Jost to me. 

From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone 
every settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some 
degree a home to me, I had imbibed from her something of her nature 
and much of her habits—more harmonious thoughts, what seemed bet- 
ter-regulated feelings, had become the inmales of my mind. I had 
given in allegiance to duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was 
content: to ihe eyes of others, usually even to my own, I appeared a 
disciplined and subdued character. 

But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me 
and Miss Temple. I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post- 
chaise, shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount 
the hill and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own 
room, and there spent in solitude the grealest part of the half-holiday 
granted in honour of the occasion. 

I walked about the chamber most of the time. I imagined myself only 
to be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my 
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the after- 
noon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on 
me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; 
that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple—or rather 
that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing 
in her vicinity—and that now I was left in my natural clement, and 
beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions, 1t did not seem as if a 
prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a molive were gone; it was not 
the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tran- 
quillity was no more. My world had for some years been in Lowood; 
my experience had been of its rules and systems: now I remembered 
that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, 
of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go 
forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils. 

I went to my window, opened it, and looked out. There were the two 
wings of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of 
Lowood; there was the hilly horizon. My eye passed all other objects to 


JANE EYRE: 71 


rest on those most remote, the blue peaks: it was those I longed to sur. 
mount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison- 
ground, exile limits. I traced the white road winding round the base of 
one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two: how I longed to 
follow it farther! I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road 
in a coach; I remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed 
to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I 
had never quitted it since. My vacations had all been spent at school: 
Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of 
her family had ever been to visit me. I had had no communication by 
letter or message with the outer world: school rules, school duties, school 
habits and notions, and voices and faces, and phrases and costumes, and 
preferences and antipathies—such was what I knew of existence. And 
now I fell that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in 
one afternoon, I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped, for liberty I ut- 
tered a prayer: it seemed scattered on the wind faintly blowing. I aban- 
doned it and framed a humbler supplication—for change, stimulus: that 
petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space. “Then,” I cried, half 
desperate, “grant me at least a new servitude!” 

Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called the dowWnstalts. 

I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till 
bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept 
me from the subject to which I Jonged to recur, by a prolonged effusion 
of small talk, How I wished sleep would silence her. Jt seemed as if, 
could I but go back to the idea which had Jast entered my mind as 1 
stood at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief. 

Miss Gryce snored at last. She was a heavy Welsh-woman, and till 
now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any 
other light than as a nuisance: to-night I hailed the first deep notes with 
satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought 
instantly revived. 

“A new servitude! There is something in that,” I soliloquized (men- 
tally, be it understood; I did not talk aloud). “I know there is, because 
it does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty, Excite- 
ment, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds for 
me, and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to listen to 
them. But Servitude! That must be matter of fact. Any one may serve: 
T have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve elsewhere. Can 
I not get so much of my own will? Is not the thing feasible? Yes— 
yes—the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain active enough to 
ferret. out the means of attaining it.” 

I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain. It was a chilly 


72 JANE EYRE 


night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded to 
think again with all my might. 

“What do I want? A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, 
under new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting 
anything better. How do people do to get a new place? They apply to 
friends, I suppose: I have no friends. There are many others who have 
no friends, who must look about for themselves and be their own help- 
ers; and what is their resource?” 

I could not tell; nothing answered me. I then ordered my brain to find 
a response, and quickly. It worked and worked faster. I felt the pulses 
throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in 
chaos; and no result came of its efforts. Feverish with vain labour, I got 
up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two, 
shivered with cold, and again crept to bed. 

A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required sugges- 
tion on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my 
mind:—~-“Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in 
the —-—~shire Herald,” 

“How? I know nothing about advertising.” 

Replies rose smooth and prompt now:— 

“You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it un- 
der a cover directed to the editor of the Herald; you must put it, the first 
opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be ad- 
dressed to J. E. at the post-office there; you can go and inquire, in about 
a week after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly.” 

This scheme I went over twice, thrice, It was then digested in my 
mind; I had it in a clear, practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep. 

With earliest day I was up. I had my advertisement written, enclosed, 
and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:— 

“A young lady accustomed to tuition” (had I not been a teacher two 
years?) “is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family 
where the children are under fourteen” (I thought that as I was barely 
eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my 
own age). “She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English 
education, together with French, Drawing, and Music” (in those days, 
reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments would have been 
held eas comprehensive). “Address, J. E., Post-office, Lowton, 
——-shire.’ 

This document remained locked in my drawer all day. After tea I 
asked leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to per- 
form some smal] commissions for mvself and one or two of my fellow- 
teachers; permission was readily granted; I went. It was a walk of two 
miles, and the evening was wet, but the days were still long. I visited a 


JANE EYRE 73 


shop or two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back 
through heavy rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart. 

The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, 
like all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant 
autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton. A picturesque 
track it was, by the way, lying along the side of the beck and through the 
sweetest curves of the dale; but that day I thought more of the letters 
that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh whither I was 
bound, than of the charms of lea and water. 

My ostensible errand on this eccasion was to get measured for a pair 
of shoes; so I discharged that/business first, and when it was done I 
stepped across the clean and @uiet little street from the shoemaker’s to 
we post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on 

r nose, and black mittens on her hands. : 

“Are there any letters for J. E.?” I asked, 

She peered at me ovey her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer 
and fumbled among its dontents for a long time, so long that my hopes 
began to falter. At last,)/ having held a document before her glasses for 
nearly five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying 
the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance—it was for J. E. 

“Ts there only one?” I demanded. 

lethere are no more,” said she; and I put it in my pocket and tumed 
Jmy face homeward. I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be 
‘back by eight, and it was already half-past seven. 

Various dutics awaited me on my arrival: I had to sit with the girls 
during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers, to see 
them to bed; afterwards I supped with the other teachers. Even when 
we finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my 
companion. We had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I 
dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out: fortunately, how- 
ever, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect; she was 
already snoring before I had finished undressing, There still remained an 
inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an initial F.; I 
broke it; the-contents were brief. 

“If J. E., who advertised in the Shire Herald of last Thursday, 
possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give 
satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can 
be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten years 
of age, and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum. J. E. is re- 
quested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the 
direction :— 

Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ——shire.” 

“{ examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and 


74 JANE EYRE 


rather uncertain, like that of an elderly lady. This circumstance was sat- 
isfactory: a privale fear had haunted me that in thus acting for myself, 
and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some scrape; and, 
above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be respectable, 
proper, ev régle, I now felt that an elderly lady was no bad ingredient in 
the business I had on hand, Mrs. Fairfax! I saw her in a black gown and 
widow’s cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil; a model of elderly English 
respectability, Thornfield! That, doubtless, was the name of her house: 
a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I failed in my efforts to conceive 
a correct plan of the premises. Millcote, shire: I brushed up my 
recollections of the map of England; yes, I saw it, both the shire and the 
town, shire was seventy miles nearer London than the remote coun- 
ty whcre I now resided: that was a recommendation to me. I longed to 
go where there was life and movement: Millcote was a large manufac- 
turing town on the banks of the A: ; a busy place enough, doubtless: 
so much the betler; it would be a complete change, at last. Not that my 
fancy was much captivated by the idea of long chimneys and clouds of 
smoke—“but,” I argued, “Thornfield will, probably, be a good way 
from the town.” 

Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out. 

Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be 
confined to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their 
success. Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent 
during the noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a 
new situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for 
at Lowood I only got £15 per annum); and requested she would break 
the matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committce, and 
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references. 
She obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter. The next 
day she laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs, Recd 
must be written to, as she was my natural guardian. A note was accord- 
ingly addressed to that lady, who returned for answer that “I might do 
as I pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs.” 
This note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what ap- 
peared to me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my 
condition if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always con- 
ducted myself well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial 
of character and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, 
should forthwith be furnished me. 

This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded 
a copy of it to Mrs, Fairfax, and got that lady’s reply, stating that she 
was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my assuni- 
ing the post of governess in her house. 


JANE EYRE 75 


I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly. I 
had not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and 
the last day sufficed to pack my trunk—the same I had brought with me 
eight years ago from Gateshead. 

The box was corded, the card nailed on. In half an hour the carrier 
was to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at 
at early hour the next morning to meet the coach. I had brushed my 
black stuff travelling dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; 
sought in all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now, 
having nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest. I could not; 
though I had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I 
was too much excited, A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one 
opening to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch 
feverishly while the change was being accomplished, 

“Miss,” said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wander- 
ing like a troubled spirit, ‘a person below wishes to see you.” 

“The carrier, no doubt,” I thought, and ran downstairs without in- 
quiry. I was passing the back-parlour or teachers’ sitting-room, the door 
of which was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out. 

“It’s her, J am sure!—I could have told her anywhere!” cried the in- 
dividual who stopped my progress and took my hand. 

T looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly, 
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively 
complexion. 

“Well, who is it?” she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half recog- 
nized; “you’ve not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?” 

In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously. “Bes« 
sie! Bessie! Bessie!” that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half 
cried, and we both went into the parlour. By the fire stood a little fellow 
of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers. 

“That is my little boy,” said Bessie directly. 

“Then you are married, Bessie?” 

“Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and 
T’ve a little girl besides Bobby there, that I’ve christened Jane,” 

“And you don’t live at Gateshead?” 

“T live at the lodge: the old porter has left.” 

“Well, and how do they all get on? Tell me every thing about them, 
Bessie. But sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will 
you?” but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother. 

“You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout,” con- 
tinued Mrs. Leaven. “I dare say they’ve not kept you too well at schools 
Miss Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are, and Miss Geor= 
giana would make two of you in breadth.” 


76 JANE EYRE 


“Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?” 

“Very. She went up to London last winter with her mamma, and there 
everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her; but his 
relations were against the match, and—what do you think?—hbe and 
Miss Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found and 
stopped. It was Miss Reed that found them out—I believe she was en- 
vious; and now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together—they 
are always quartelling.” 

“Well, and what of John Reed?” 

“Oh, he is not doing so well as his mamma could wish. He went to col- 
lege, and he got—plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles want- 
ed him to be a barrister, and study the law; but he is such a dissipated 
young man, they will never make much of him, I think.” 

“What does he look like?” 

“Fe is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but 
he has such thick lips,” 

"And Mrs. Reed?” 

“Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she’s not 
quite easy in her mind: Mr. John’s conduct does not please her—he 
spends a deal of money.” 

“Did she send you here, Bessie?” 

“No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when J heard 
that there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to an- 
other part of the country, I thought I’d just set off, and get a look at you 
before you were quite out of my reach.” 

“I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.” I said this laugh- 
ing: I perceived that Bessic’s glance, though it expressed regard, did in 
no shape denote admiration. 

“No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a 
lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you—you were no beauty 
as a child.” 

T smiled at Bessie’s frank answer, I felt that it was correct; but I con- 
fess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most people 
wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to 
second that desire brings anything but gratification. 

“I dare say you are clever, though,” continued Bessie, by way of so- 
Jace, “What can you do? Can you play on the piano?” 

“A little,” 

There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked 
mie to sit down and give her a tune. I played a waltz or two, and she was 
charmed. 

“The Miss Reeds could not play as well!” said she exultingly. “I al- 
ways said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?” 


JANE EYRE 77 


“That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.” It was a land- 
scape in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superin- 
tendent, in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the commit- 
tee on my behalf, and which she had framed and glazed. 

“Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane! It is as fine a picture as any Miss 
Reed’s drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies them- 
selves, who could not come near it: and have you learned French?” 

“Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it.” 

“And you can work on muslin and canvas?” 

“T can.” 

“Qh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane! I knew you would be: you will 
get on whether your relations notice you or not. There was something I 
wanted to ask you, Have you ever heard anything from your father’s 
kinsfolk, the Eyres?” 

“Never in my life.” 

“Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despic- 
able: and they may be poor, but I believe they are as much gentry as the 
Reeds are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr, Eyre came to 
Gateshead and wanted to see you. Missis said you were at school fifty 
miles off; he seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was 
going on a voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from 
London in a day or two. He looked quite a gentleman, and 1 believe he 
was your father’s brother.” 

“What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?” 

“An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine—the butler 
did tell me——” : 

“Madeira?” I suggested, 

“Ves, that is it—that is the very word.” 

“So he went?” 

“Yes: he did not stay many minutes in the house. Missis was very 
high with him; she called him afterwards a ‘sneaking tradesman,’ My 
Robert believes he was a wine-merchant.” 

“Very likely,’ I returned; “or perhaps clerk or agent to a wine- 
merchant.” 

Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she 
was obliged to leave me. I saw her again for a few minutes the next 
morning at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach. We parted finally 
at the door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate 
way; she set off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance 
which was to take her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which 
was to bear me to new duties and a new life in the unknown environs of 
Millcote.

CHAPTER XI 


A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and 
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you sec a 
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large-figured papering on 
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such orna- 
ments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George the 
Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of the 
death of Wolfe. All this is visible to you by the light of an oil lamp 
hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near which I sit 
in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the table, and I am 
warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixtecn hours’ ex- 
posure io the rawness of an October day: T left Lowton at four o’clock 
a.m., and the Millcote Lown clock is now just striking eight. 

Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am noi very 
tranquil in my mind. I thought when the coach stopped here there would 
be some one to meet me. I looked anxiously round as I descended the 
wooden stcps the “boots” placed for my convenience, expecting Lo hear 
my name pronounced, and to see some description of carriage waiting to 
convey me to Thornfield, Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I 
asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire afler a Miss Eyre, I was 
answered in the negative: so I had no resource but to request to be 
shown into a private room; and here I am waiting, while all sorts of 
doubts and fears are troubling my thoughts. 

It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself quite 
alone in (he world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain whether 
the port to which if, is bound can be reached, and prevented by many im- 
pediments from returning to that it has quitted. The charm of adven- 
ture swectens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it: but then the 
throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when 
half oa hour elapsed and still I was alone, I bethought myself to ring 
the bell. 

“Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?” I asked of 
the waiter who answered the summons. 

“Thornfield? I don’t know, ma’am; I'll inquire at the bar.” He van- 
ished, but reappeared insiantly— 

“Ts ‘your name Eyre, Miss?” 

Veg? 

“Person here waiting for you,” 

I jumped up, teok my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the inn 


JANE EVRE 79 


passage: 4 man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit street 
I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance. 

“This will be your luggage, I suppose?” said the man rather abruptly 
when he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage. 

“Yes.” He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and 
then I got in. Before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to 
Thornfield. 

“A matter of six miles.” 

“How long shall we be before we get there?” 

“Happen an hour and a half.” 

He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set 
off. Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect. I 
was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I 
leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I medi- 
tated much at my ease. 

“T suppose,” thought I, “judging from the plainness of the servant and 
carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better; 
I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable 
with them. I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if 
she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her. I 
will do my best: it is a pity that doing one’s best does not always answer. 
At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and succeeded in 
pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always spurned 
with scorn. I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second Mrs. 
Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her: let the worst 
come to the worst, I can advertise again. How far are we on our road 
now, I wonder?” 

J let down the window and looked out: Millcote was behind us; judging 
by the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude, 
much larger than Lowton. We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort 
of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district: I felt 
we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less pictur- 
esque; more stirring, less romantic. 

The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse 
walk all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to 
two hours: at last he turned in his seat and said,— 

“You're noan so far fro’ Thornfield now.” 

Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad 
tower against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow 
galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet, About ten 
minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we passed 
through, and they clashed to behind us. We now slowly ascended a 
drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed 


80 JANE EYRE 


from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark, The car stopped 
at the front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and 
went in. 

‘Will you walk this way, ma’am?” said the girl; and I followed her 
across a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a 
room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, 
contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for 
two hours inured; when I could sce, however, a cosy and agreeable pic- 
ture presented itself to my view. 

A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair 
high-backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little 
elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron— 
exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and mild- 
er looking, She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely at her 
fect; nothing, in short, was wanling to complete the beau-ideal of do- 
mestic comfort. A more reassuring introduction for a new governess 
could scarcely be conccived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no 
stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and 
promptly and kindly came forward to meet me. 

“Flow do you do, my dear? I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; 
John drives so slowly, You must be cald; come to the fire.” 

“Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?” said I. 

“Yes, you are right; do sit down.” 

She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my 
shawl and untie my bonnet-slrings. I begged she would not give herself 
so much trouble, 

“Oh, it is no trouhle; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed 
with cold. Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here 
are the keys of the storeroom.” 

And she produced from her pocket a most house-wifely bunch of keys, 
and delivered them to the servant. 

“Now, then, draw nearer to the fire,” she continued, ‘You've brought 
your luggage with you, haven’t you, my dear?” 

“Yes, ma’am.” 

“Tl see it carried into your room,” she said, and bustled out, 

“She treats me like a visitor,” thought I. “I little expected such a re- 
ception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness; this is not like what I 
have heard of the treatment of governesses: but I must not exult too 
soon.” 

She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and 
a book or two from the table, Lo make room for the tray which Leah now 
brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments. I felt rather con- 
fused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before re- 


JANE EYRE 81 


ceived, and that, too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she did 
not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place, I 
thought it better to take her civilities quietly. 

“Shall [ have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax tonight?” I asked, 
when J had partaken of what she offered me. 

“What did you say, my dear? I am a little deaf,” returned the good 
lady, approaching her ear to my mouth. 

I repeated the question more distinctly. 

“Miss Fairfax? Oh, you mean Miss Varens! Varens is the name of 
your future pupil.” 

“Indeed! Then she is not your daughter?” 

“No; I have no family.” 

I should have followed up my first inquiry by asking in what way Miss 
Vareng was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to 
ask too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time, 

“I am so glad,” she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and 
took the cat on her knee—“I am so glad you are come; it will be quite 
pleasant living here now with a companion, To be sure it is pleasant at 
any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late years 
perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in winter time 
one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters. I say alone. Leah is a 
nice girl, to be sure, and John and his wife are very decent people; but 
then you see they are only servants, and one can’t converse with them on 
terms of equality: one must keep them at due distance, for fear of los- 
ing one’s authority. I’m sure last winter (it was a very severe one, if you 
recollect, and when it did not snow it rained and blew) not a creature but 
the butcher and postman came to the house, from November till Febru- 
ary; and I really got quite melancholy with silting night after night 
alone. I had Leah in to read to me sometimes: but I don’t think the 
poor girl liked the task much; she felt it confining, In spring and sum- 
mer one got on better: sunshine and long days make such a difference; 
and then, just at the commencement of this autumn, little Adela Varens 
came and her nurse: a child makes a house alive all at once; and now 
you are here I shall be quite gay.” 

My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I 
drew my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that 
she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated. 

“But Vl not keep you sitting up late to-night,” said she; “it is on the 
stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must 
feel tired, If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your 
bedroom, I’ve had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a 
small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the 


a 


82 JANE EYRE 


large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are 
so dreary and solilary I never sleep in them myself,” 

I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued 
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire. She took her 
candle, and I followed her from the room. First she went Lo sec if the 
hall door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the 
way upstairs. The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window 
was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the bed- 
room doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a 
house. A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery, 
suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when 
finally ushered into my chamber, 1o find it of small dimensions, and fur- 
nished in ordinary, modern style. 

When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fas- 
tened my door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the 
eerie impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious stair- 
case, and that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, 
T remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I 
‘was now at last in safc haven, The impulse of gratitude swelled my 
heart, and I knelt down at the bedside and offered up thanks where 
thanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further 
path, and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly 
offered me before it was earned, My couch had no thorns in it that 
night; my solitary room no fears. At once weary and content, I slept 
soon and soundly; when I awoke it was broad day, 

The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone 
in between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing paperec walls 
and a carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of 
Lowood, that my spirits rose at the view. Externals have a great. effect 
on the young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me 
one that was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and 
toils. My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered 
to hope, seemed all astir. I cannot precisely define what they expected, 
bul it was something pleasant—not perhaps that, day or that month, but 
at an indefinite future period. 

I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain—for I had no 
article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity-—-I was still 
by nature solicitous to be neat. It was not my habit to be disregardful of 
appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I ever 
wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want of 
beauty would permit. I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer; 
I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small 


JANE EYRE 83 


cherry mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in fig- 
ure; I felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features 
so irregular and so marked. And why had I these aspirations and these 
regrets? It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say it 
to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too. How- 
ever, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black 
frock—which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting toa 
nicety—and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do re- 
spectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil 
would not at least recoil from me with antipathy. Having opened my 
chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the 
toilet table, I ventured forth. 

Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps 
of oak; then I gained the hall, I halted there a minute; I looked at some 
pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a 
cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a 
bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of 
oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing, Everything 
appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little accus- 
tomed to grandeur. The hall door, which was half of glass, stood open; 
I stepped over the threshold. It was a fine autumn morning; the early 
sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields. Advanc- 
ing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the mansion. 
Tt was three stories high, of proportions not vast, though considerable: a 
gentleman’s manor-house, not a nobleman’s seat: battlements round the 
top gave it a picturesque look. Its gray front stood out well from the 
background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants were now on the wing: 
they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a great meadow, from 
which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where an array of 
mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at once ex- 
plained the etymology of the mansion’s designation, Farther off were 
hills; not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so like bar- 
riers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and lonely hills 
enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I had not 
expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of Millcote. A litile 
hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled up the side of one of 
these hills; the church of the district stood nearer Thornfield: its old 
tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and gates. 

I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet listen: 
ing with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the wide, 
hoary front of the hail, and thinking what a great place it was for one 


84 JANE EYRE 


lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady appeared 
at the door. 

“What! out already?” said she. “I see you are an early riser.” I 
went up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the 
hand. 

‘How do you like Thornfield?” she asked. I told her I liked it very 
much. 

“Ves,” she said, “it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out 
of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and 
reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great houses 
and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor.” 

“Mir. Rochester!” I exclaimed. ‘Who is he?” 

“The owner of Thornfield,” she responded quietly, “Did you not 
know he was called Rochester?” 

Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old 
lady seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, 
with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct, 

“T thought,” I continued, “‘Thornfield belonged to you.” 

“To me? Bless you, child; what an idea! To me! I am only the 
housekccper—the manager. To be sure, I am distantly related to the 
Rochesters by the mother’s side, or at least my husband was; he was a 
"clergyman, incumbent of Hay—that little village yonder on the hill— 
and that church near the gates was his, The present Mr. Rochester’s 
mother was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband. But I never 
presume on the connection—in fact, it is nothing to me: I consider my- 
self quite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper; my employer is al- 
ways civil, and I expect nothing more.” 

“And the little girl—my pupil!” 

“She is Mr. Rochester’s ward; he commissioned me to find a gov- 
erness for her. He intends to have her brought up in ~——shire, I be- 
lieve. Here she comes, with her ‘bonne,’ as she calls her nurse.” The 
enigma then was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no 
great dame, but a dependant like myself, I did not like her the worse 
for thal; on the contrary, I felt better pleased than ever. The equality 
between her and me was real; not the mere result of condescension an 
her part: so much the better—my position was all the freer. 

As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her at- 
tendant, came running up the lawn. I looked at my pupil, who did not 
at first appear 1o nolice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or 
eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a 
redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist. 

“Good-morning, Miss Adela,” said Mrs, Fairfax. “Come and speak 


JANE EYRE 85 


to the lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some 
day.” She approached. 

“C’est la ma gouvernante?” said she, pointing to me, and addiessing 
her nurse; who answered,— 

“Mais oui, certainement.” 

“Are they foreigners?” I inquired, amazed at hearing the French 
language. 

“The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent, and, 
I believe, never left it till within six months ago. When she first came 
here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a 

: little. T don’t understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will 
make out her meaning very well, I dare say.” 

Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a 
French lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with 
Madame Pierrot as often as I could, and had besides, during the last 
seven years, learned a portion of French by heart daily—applying my- 
self to take pains with my accent, and imitating as closely as possible 
the pronunciation of my teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of 
readiness and correctness in the language, and was not likely to be much 
at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela. She came and shook hands with me 
when she heard that I was her governess; and as I led her in to break- 
fast, I addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue. She replied 
briefly at first; but after we were seated at the table, and she had ex- 
amined me some ten minutes with her large hazel eyes, she suddenly 
commenced chattering fluently. 

“Ah!” cried she, in French, “you speak my language as well as Mr. 
Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie. 
She will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all 
English. Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great 
ship with a chimney that smoked—how it did smoke!—and I was sick, 
and so was Sophie, and so was Mr, Rochester. Mr. Rochester lay down 
on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little 
beds in another place. I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf. And, 
Mademoiselle—what is your name?” 

“Eyre—Jane Eyre.” 

“Aire? Bah! I cannot say it. Well, our ship stopped in the morning, 
before it was quite daylight, at a great city—a huge city, with very dark 
houses and all smoky; not at all ike the pretty clean town I came from; 
and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land, and 
Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a beau- 
tiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel. We stayed 
there nearly a week, I and Sophie used to walk every day in a great 


86 JANE EYRE 


green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many children 
there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I fed with 
crumbs.” 

“Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?” asked Mrs. 
Fairfax. 

I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fiuent 
tongue of Madame Pierrot. 

“T wish,” continued the good lady, “you would ask her a question or 
two about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?” 

“Adéle,” I inquired, “with whom did you live when you were in that 
pretty clean town you spoke of?” 

“T lived Jong ago with mamma; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin. 
Mamma used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses, A great 
many gentlemen and ladies came to see mamma, and I used to dance 
before them, or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it. Shall 
I let you hear me sing now?” 

She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen 
of her accomplishments. Descending from her chair, she came and 
placed herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely be- 
fore her, shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she 
commenced singing a song from some opera. It was the strain of a for- 
saken lady, who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to 
her aid; desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and 
richest robes; and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, 
and prove to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his deser- 
tion has affected her. 

The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I sup- 
pose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and 
jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood: and in very bad taste that 
point was; at least I thought so. 

Adéle sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the naiveté of 
her age. This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, “Now, 
Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry.” 

Assuming an attitude, she began “La Ligue ‘des Rats: fable de La 
Fontaine.” She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to 
punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness 
of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had 
been carefully trained. 

“Was it your mamma who taught you that piece?” I asked. 

“Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: ‘Qu’avez-vous donc? lui 
dit un de ces rats; parlez!’ She made me lift my hand—so—to remind 
me to raise my voice at the question, Now shall I dance for you?” 


JANE EYRE 87 


“No, that will do. But after your mamma went to the Holy Virgin, 
as you say, with whom did you live then?” 

“With Madame Frédéric and her husband: she took care of me, but 
she is nothing related to me. I think she is poor, for she had not so 
fine a house as mamma. I was not long there. Mr. Rochester asked me 
if I would like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I 
knew Mr, Rochester before I knew Madame Frédéric, and he was al- 
ways kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he 
has not kept his word, for he has brought me to England, and now he is 
gone back again himself, and I never see him.” 

After breakfast, Adéle and I withdrew to the library, which room, it 
appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom. 
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one 
bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the 
way of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry, 
biography, travels, a few romances, etc. I suppose he had considered 
that these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; 
and, indeed, they contented me amply for the present: compared with 
the scanty pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, 
they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and informa- 
tion. In this room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of 
superior tone; also an easel for painting, and a pair of globes. 

I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she 
had not been used to regular occupation of any kind. I felt it would be 
injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to her 
a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had ad- 
vanced ta noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse. I then proposed to 
occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her 
use. 

As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fair- 
fax called to me. ‘Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose,” 
said she. She was in a room the folding doors of which stood open: I 
went in when she addressed me. It was a large, stately apartment, with 
purple chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one 
vast window rich in stained glass, and a lofty ceiling nobly moulded. 
Mrs, Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar which stood on 
a sideboard. 

“What a beautiful room!” I exclaimed, as I looked round, for I had 
never before seen any half so imposing. 

“Yes; this is the dining-room. I have just opened the window, to let 
in a little Air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments 
that are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault,” 


88 JANE EYRE 


She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung 
like it with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up. Mounting to it by 
two broad steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a 
fairy place, so bright to my novice eyes appeared the view beyond. Vet 
it was merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both 
spread with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of 
flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine 
leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and otto- 
mans; while the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of 
sparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red, and between the windows large mir- 
rors repeated the general blending of snow and fire. 

“Tn what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!” said I. “No 
dust, no canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would 
think they were inhabited daily.” 

‘Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester’s visits here are rare, they 
are always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him 
out to find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement 
on his arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness.” 

“Ts Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?” 

“Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman’s tastes and habits, and 
he expects to have things managed in conformity to them.” 

“Do you like him? Is he generally liked?” 

“Oh, yes; the’family have always been respected here. Almost all the 
land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the 
Rochesters time out of mind.” 

“Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him? Is 
he liked for himself?” 

“T have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is 
considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never 
lived much amongst them.” 

“But has he no peculiarities? What, in short, is his character?” 

“Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose. He is rather peculiar, 
perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the 
world, I should think. I dare say he is clever, but I never had much 
conversation with him,” 

“In what way is he peculiar?” 

“I don’t know—it is not easy to describe—nothing striking, but you 
feel it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is 
in jest or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you'don’t thor- 
oughly understand him, in short—at least, I don’t: but it istof no con- 
sequence, he is a very good master.” : 

This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and 


JANE EYRE 89 


mine, There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a char- 
acter, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons or 
things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries puz- 
zled, but did not draw her out. Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her 
eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor—nothing more: she inquired 
and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a 
more definite notion of his identity. 

When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest 
of the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I 
went, for all was well arranged and handsome. The large front cham-, 
bers I thought especially grand; and some of the third-story rooms, 
though dark and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity. The 
furniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to 
time been removed here, as fashions changed, and the imperfect light 
entering by their narrow casements showed bedsteads of a hundred 
years old; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings 
of palm branches and cherubs’ heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows 
of venerable chairs, high-backed and narrow; stools still more anti- 
quated, on whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half- 
effaced embroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had 
been coffin-dust. All these relics gave to the third story of Thornfield 
Hall the aspect of a home of the past—a shrine of memory. I liked the 
hush, the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I by 
no means coveted a night’s repose on one of those wide and heavy beds 
—shut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded, others, with 
wrought old English hangings crusted with thick work, portraying ef- 
figies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings, 
~—all which would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of 
moonlight, 

“Do the servants sleep in these rooms?” I asked. 

“No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back. No one 
ever sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at 
Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt.” 

“So I think: you have no ghost, then?” 

“None that I ever heard of,” returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling. 

“Nor any traditions of one—no legends or ghost stories?” 

“T believe not. And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a 
violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the rea~ 
son they rest tranquilly in their graves now.” 

“Ves—after life’s fitful fever they sleep well,’ ? I muttered. “Where 
are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?” for she was moving away. 

“On to the leads: will you come and see the view from thence?” J 


90 JANE EYRE 


followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a 
ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall. I was now on a 
level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests. Leaning over 
the battlements and looking far down, J surveyed the grounds laid out 
like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the gray base of 
the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber; 
the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener 
with moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the 
road, the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day’s sun; the horizon 
bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white. No 
feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing. When I 
turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way 
down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that 
arch of blue air which I bad been looking up, and to that sunlit scene of 
grove, pasture, and green hill of which the hall was the centre, and over 
which I had been gazing with delight. 

Mys. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by 
dint of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to de- 
scend the narrow garret staircase. I lingered in the long passage to which 
this led, separating the front and back rooms of the third story: nar- 
row, low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and look- 
ing, with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in 
some Bluebeard’s castle. 

While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a 
region, a laugh, struck my ear. It was a curious laugh—distincf, formal, 
tnirthless. I stopped. The sound ceased, only for an instant: it began 
again, louder; for at first, though distinct, it was very low. It passed off 
in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every lonely cham-~ 
ber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed out the 
door whence the accents issued. 

“Mrs. Fairfax!” I called out—for I now heard her descending the 
Great stairs—'‘‘did you hear that loud laugh? Who is it?” 

: od of the servants, very likely,” she answered—‘‘perhaps Grace 

‘oole.”’ : 

“Did you hear it?” I again inquired. 

“Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms. 
Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together.” 

The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an 
odd murmur. 

“Grace!” exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, 

I really did not expect any Grace to answer, for the laugh was as 
tragic, as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and but that it was 


JANE EYRE gt 


high noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the 
curious cachinnation—but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, 
I should have been superstitiously afraid. However, the event showed 
me I was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise. 

The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out—a woman of 
between thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and 
with a hard, plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly 
could scarcely be conceived. 

“Too much noise, Grace,” said Mrs. Fairfax. “Remember direc- 
tions!” Grace curtsied silently, and went in. 

“She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid’s 
work,” continued the widow; “not altogether unobjectionable in some 
points, but she does well enough. By-the-bye, how have you got on 
with your new pupil this morning?” 

The conversation, thus turned on Adéle, continued till we reached the 
light and cheerful region below. Adéle came running to meet us in the 
hall, exclaiming, — 

“Mesdames, vous étes servies!” adding, “J’ai bien faim, moi!” 

We found dinner ready and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax’s room. 


CHAPTER XII 


THE promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction te. 
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaint: 
tance with the place and its inmates. Mrs. Fairfax turned out to ba 
what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of com- 
petent education and average intelligence. My pupil was a lively child, 
who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes way- 
ward; but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious 
interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improve- 
ment, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became obedient and teach- 
able. She had no great talents, no marked traits of character, no pecu- 
liar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the 
ordinary level of childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice 
which sunk her below it. She made reasonable progress, entertained for 
me a vivacious though perhaps not very profound affection; and by her 
simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with 
a degree of attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other’s 
society. 

This, par parenthese, will be thought cool language by persons who en- 
tertain soleman doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the 


92 JANE EYRE 


duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an 
idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to 
echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth. I felt a 
conscientious solicitude for Adéle’s welfare and progress, and a quiet 
liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a 
thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society propor- 
tionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation of her 
mind and character. 

Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further that, now and 
then, when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to 
the gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adéle 
played with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I 
climbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and hav- 
ing reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, 
and along dim sky-line—that then I longed for a power of vision which 
might overpass that limit, which might reach the busy world, towns, 
regions full of life I had heard of but never seen—that then I desired 
more of practical experience than I possessed, more of intercourse with 
my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here with- 
in my reach. I valued what was good in Mrs, Fairfax, and what was 
good in Adéle; but I believed in the existence of other and more vivid 
kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to behold. 

Who blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discon- 
tented. I could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agi- 
tated me to pain sometimes. Then my sole relief was to walk along the 
corridor of the third story, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence 
and solitude of the spot, and allow my mind’s eye to dwell on whatever 
bright visions rose before it—and, certainly, they were many and glow- 
ing; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement which, while 
it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my 
inward ear to a tale that was never ended—a tale my imagination cre- 
ated, and narrated continuously, quickened with all of incident, life, fire, 
feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence. 

It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satished with tran- 
quillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot 
find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions 
ate in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows how many rebel- 
lions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which peo- 
ple earth, Women are supposed to be very calm generally. But women 
feel just as men feel: they need exercise for their faculties, and a field 
for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid 
a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; 


JANE EVRE 93 


and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say 
that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting 
stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thought- 
less to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or 
learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex. 

When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole’s laugh— 
the same peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had 
thrilled me. I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs—stranger than her 
laugh. There were days when she was quite silent; but there were 
others when I could not account for the sounds she made. Sometimes 
I saw her: she would come out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or 
a tray in her hand, go down to the kitchen and shortly return, generally 
(oh, romantic reader, forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a 
pot of porter. Her appearance always acted as a damper to the curi- 
osity raised by her oral oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no 
point to which interest could attach. I made some attempts to draw her 
into conversation, but she seemed a person of few words: a mono- 
syllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort, 

The other members of the household—namely, John and his wife, 
Leah the housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse—were decent peo- 
ple, but in no respect remarkable. With Sophie I used to talk French, 
and sometimes I asked her questions about her native country; but she 
was not of a descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid 
and confused answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage 
inquiry. 

October, November, December passed away. One afternoon in Jan- 
uary, Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adéle, because she had a 
cold; and as Adéle seconded the request with an ardour that reminded 
me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in my own child- 
hood, I accorded it, deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the 
point. It was a fine, calm day, though very cold. I was tired of sitting 
still in the library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just 
written a letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet 
and cloak and volunteered to carry it to Hay—the distance, two miles, 
would be a pleasant winter afternoon walk, Having seen Adéle com- 
fortably seated in her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour fireside, and 
given her her best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver 
paper in a drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amuse- 
ment; and having replied to her “Revenez bientét, ma bonne amie, ma 
chére Mile. Jeannette,” with a kiss I set out. 

The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely. I walked 
fast. till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyze the 


a 


94 ‘ JANE EYRE 


species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation. It was 
three o’clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the 
charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and 
pale-beaming sun. I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for 
wild roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even 
now possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best 
winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose. If a breath of 
air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an 
evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as 
still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path. 
Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now 
browsed; and the little brown birds which stirred occasionally in the 
hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop. 

This lane inclined uphill all the way to Hay. Having reached the 
middle, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field. Gathering 
my mantle about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel 
the cold, though it froze keenly, as was attested by a sheet of ice cover- 
ing the causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had over- 
flowed after a rapid thaw some days since. From my seat I could look 
down on Thornfield: the gray and battlemented hall was the principal 
object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the 
west. I lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank 
crimson and clear behind them. I then turned eastward. 

On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon: pale yet as a cloud, but 
brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees, 
sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys. It was yet a mile distant, 
but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life. 
My ear, too, felt the flow of currents—in what dales and depths I could 
not tell; but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many 
becks threading their passes. That evening calm betrayed alike the 
tinkle of the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote. 

A rude noise broke on these fine rippling and whisperings, at once so 
far away and so clear—a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which 
effaced the soft wave-wanderings: as, in a picture, the solid mass of a 
crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the 
foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and 
blended clouds where tint melts into tint. 

The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of 
_ the lane yet hid it, but it approached. I was just leaving the stile; yet, 
as the path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by. In those days I was 
young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind; the 
memories of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and 


JANE EYRE 95 


when they recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vivid- 
ness beyond what childhood could give. As this horse approached, and 
as I watched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of 
Bessie’s tales wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a “Gy- 
trash,” which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted soli- 
tary ways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse 
was now coming upon me. 

It was very near, but not yet in sight, when, in addition to the 
tramp, tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the 
hazel stems glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him 
a distinct object against the trees. It was exactly one form of Bessie’s 
Gytrash—a lionlike creature with long hair and a huge head. It passed 
me, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pre- 
tercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would. The horse fol- 
lowed—a tall steed, and on its back a rider. The man, the human being, 
broke the spell at once. Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always 
alone; and goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb 
carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace hu- 
man form, No Gytrash was this—only a traveller taking the short cut 
to Millcote. He passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a 
sliding sound and an exclamation of, “What the deuce is to do now?” 
and a clattering tumble, arrested my attention. Man and horse were 
down; they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway. 
The dog came bounding back, and seeing his master in a predicament, 
and hearing the horse groan, barked till the evening hills echoed the 
sound, which was deep in proportion to his magnitude. He snuffed round 
the prostrate group, and then he ran up to me: it was all he could do— 
there was no other help at hand to summon. I obeyed him, and walked 
down to the traveller, by this time struggling himself free of his steed. 
His efforts were so vigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but 
T asked him the question, — 

“Are you injured, sir?” 

I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pro- 
nouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to me 
directly, 

“Can I do anything?” I asked again. 

“You must just stand on one side,” he answered as he rose, first to 
his knees, and then to his feet. I did; whereupon began a heaving, 
stamping, clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying 
which removed me effectually some yards’ distance; but I would not be 
driven quite away till I saw the event. This was finally fortunate: the 
horse was re-established, and the dog was silenced with a ‘Down, Pilot!” 


96 JANE EYRE 


The traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether 
they were sound: apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the 
stile whence I had just risen, and sat down. 

I was in a mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I 
now drew near him again. 

“Tf you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from 
Thornfield Hall or from Hay.” 

“Thank you; I shall do. I have no broken bones—only a sprain;” 
and again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an in- 
voluntary “Ugh!” 

Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: 
I could see him plainly. His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur 
collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced the 
general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest. He 
had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and 
gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now. He was past 
youth, but had not reached middle age; perhaps he might be thirty- 
five. I felt no fear of him, and but little shyness. Had he been a hand- 
some, heroic-looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand 
thus questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked. 
I had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to 

‘one. I had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, 
gallantry, fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in mascu- 
line shape, I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor 
could have sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned 
them as one would fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but 
antipathetic. 

If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when 
I addressed him—if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with 
thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to 
renew inquiries; but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at 
my ease. I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and an 
nounced,— 

“I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this soli- 
tary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse.” 

He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in 
my direction before. 

“I should think you ought to be at home yourself,” said he, “if you 
have a home in this neighbourhood. Where do you come from?” 

“From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when 
it is moonlight. I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you 
wish it: indeed, I am going there to post a letter.” 


JANE EYRE 97 


“Vou live just below—do you mean at that house with the battle- 
ments?” pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary 
gleam, bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods, that, by con- 
trast with the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow. 

“Ves, sir.” 

“Whose house is it?” 

“Mr. Rochester’s.” 

“Do you know Mr. Rochester?” 

“No, I have never seen him.” 

“He is not resident, then?” 

“No.” 

“Can you tell me where he is?” 

“T cannot.” 

“You are not a servant at the hall, of course. You are——” He 
stopped, ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple— 
a black merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine 
enough for a lady’s-maid, He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I 
helped him. 

“J am the governess.” 

“Ah, the governess!” he repeated; “deuce take me, if I had not for- 
gotten! The governess!” and again my raiment underwent scrutiny. In 
two minutes he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he 
tried to move. : 

“I cannot commission you to fetch help,” he said; “but you may help 
me a little yourself, if you will be so kind.” 

“Ves, sir.” 

“You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?” 

“No,” 

“Try to get hold of my horse’s bridle and lead him to me: you are 
not afraid?” 

I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told 
to do it I was disposed to obey. I put down my muff on the stile, and 
went up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle; but it was 
a spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head. I made effort 
on effort, though in vain: meantime I was mortally afraid of its tramp- 
ling forefeet. The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at 
last he laughed. 

“T see,” he said, “the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so 
all you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of 
you to come here.” 

T came. “Excuse me,” he continued: “necessity compels me to make 
you useful.” He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder. and leaning on me 


98 JANE EYRE 


with some stress, limped to his horse. Having once caught the bridle, he 
mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle—grimacing grimly as he 
made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain. 

“Now,” said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, “just hand 
me my whip; it lies there under the hedge.” 

JT sought it and found it. 

“Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as 
fast as you can.” 

A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and 
then bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished, 


“Like heath that, in the wilderness, 
The wild wind whirls away.” 


I took up my muff and walked on. The incident had occurred and 
was gone from me: it was an incident of no moment, no romance, no 
interest in a sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a 
monotonous life. My help had been needed and claimed: I had given it: 
I was pleased to have done something; trivial, transitory though the 
deed was, it was yet an active thing, and I was weary of an existence all 
passive. The new face, too, was like a new picture introduced to the 
gallery of memory; and it was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: 
firstly, because it was masculine; and secondly, because it was dark, 
strong, and stern, I had it still before me when I entered Hay, and 
slipped the letter into the post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down- 
hill all the way home. When I came to the stile I stopped a minute, 
looked round and listened, with an idea that a horse’s hoofs might ring 
on the causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like 
Newfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a 
pollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the moon- 
beams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the 
trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down in the 
direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught a 
light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I hur- 
tied on, 

I did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its threshold was to re- 
turn to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome 
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil 
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only, 
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk—to slip 
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of a uniform and too still 
existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I 
was becoming incapable of appreciating. What good it would have done 


JANE EYRE 99 


me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain strug- 
gling life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long 
for the calm amidst which I now repined! Ves, just as much good as it 
would do a man tired of sitting still in a “too easy chair” to take a long 
walk; and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances, 
as it would be under his. 

I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards 
and forwards on the pavement. The shutters of the glass door were 
closed; I could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit 
seemed drawn from the gloomy house—from the gray hollow filled with 
rayless cells, as It appeared to me—to that sky expanded before me, a 
blue sea absolved from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn 
march, her orb seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind 
which she had come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the 
zenith, midnight-dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; 
and for those trembling stars that followed her course, they made my 
heart tremble, my veins glow when I viewed them. Little things recall 
us to earth: the clock struck in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from 
moon and stars, opened a side door, and went in. 

The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung 
bronze lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the 
oak staircase. This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, 
whose two-leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, 
glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple 
draperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance, It re- 
vealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I bad scarcely caught it, and 
scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which 
I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adéle, when the door closed, 

I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax’s room; there was a fire there too, but no 
candle, and no Mrs, Fairfax. Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the 
rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and 
white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane. It was so like it 
that I went forward and said, “Pilot,” and the thing got up and came 
to me and snuffed me. I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; 
but he looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell 
whence he had come. I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and T 
wanted, too, to get an account of this visitant. Leah entered. 

“What dog is this?” 

“He came with master.” 

“With whom?” 

“With master—Mr. Rochester—he is just arrived.” 

“Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?” 


100 JANE EYRE 


“Yes, and Miss Adéle; they are in the dining-room. And John is gone 
for a surgeon; for master has had an accident: his horse fell and his 
ankle is sprained.” 

“Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?” 

“Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice.” 

“Ah! Bring me a candle, will you, Leah?” 

Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who re- 
peated the news, adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was 
now with Mr. Rochester. Then she hurried out to give orders about 
tea, and I went upstairs to take off my things, 


CHAPTER XIII 


Mr. RocHester, it seems, by the surgeon’s orders, went to bed early 
that night; nor did he rise soon next morning. When he did come down, 
it was to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were 
arrived, and waiting to speak to him. 

Adéle and I had now to vacate the library; it would be in daily re- 
quisition as a reception-room for callers. A fire was lit in an apart- 
ment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for the 
future schoolroom. I discerned in the course of the morning that 
Thornfield Hall was a changed place. No longer silent as a church, it 
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door or a clang of the bell; 
steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different 
keys below: a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a 
master. For my part, I liked it better. 

Adéle was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply. She kept 
running to the door and looking over the banisters to sce if she could get 
a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go downstairs, 
in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library, where I knew she 
was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and made her sit still, 
she continued to talk incessantly of her “ami, Monsieur Edouard Fair- 
fax de Rochester,” as she dubbed him (I had not before heard his pre- 
nomens), and to conjecture what presents he had brought her: for it 
appears he had intimated, the night before, that when his luggage came 
from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little box in whose 
contents she had an interest, 

“Et cela doit signifier,” said she, “qu’il y aura ]& dedans un cadeau 
pour moi, et peut-étre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle, Monsieur a parlé 
de vous: il m’a demandé le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n’était 
pas une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale. J’ai dit qu’oui: car 
Cest. vrai, n’est-ce pas, mademoiselle?” 


JANE EYRE IOr 


I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour; the after- 
noon was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom. At dark 
T allowed Adéle to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; 
for, from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of ap- 
peals to the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at 
liberty. Left alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen 
thence: twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the 
very shrubs on the lawn. I let down the curtain and went back to the 
fireside, 

Tn the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I re- 
membered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when 
Mrs, Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I 
had been piecing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome 
thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude, 

“Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea 
with him in the drawing-room this evening,” said she; “he has been so 
much engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before.” 

“When is his tea-time?” I inquired. 

“Oh, at six o’clock: he keeps early hours in the country. You had 
better change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it. Here is 
a candle.” 

“Ts it necessary to change my frock?” 

“Ves, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr, 
Rochester is here.” 

This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I re- 
paired to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax’s aid, replaced my black 
stuff dress by one of black silk—the best and the only additional one I 
had, except one of light gray, which, in my Lowood notions of the 
toilette, I thought too fine to be worn except on first-rate occasions, 

“Vou want a brooch,” said Mrs, Fairfax, I had a single little pearl 
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it 
on, and then we went downstairs. Unused as I was to strangers, it was 
rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester’s 
presence. I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept 
in her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose 
curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond. 

Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantel- 
piece; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire lay Pilot; Adéle 
knelt near him, Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his 
foot supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adéle and the dog: 
the fire shone full on his face. I knew my traveller with his broad and 
jetty eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal 
sweep of his black hair. I recognized his decisive nose, more remark- 


102 JANE EYRE 


able for character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, 
choler; his grim mouth, chin, and jaw—yes, all three were very grim, 
and no mistake. His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived har- 
monized in squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good 
figure in the athletic sense of the term—broad chested and thin flanked, 
though neither tall nor graceful. 

Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fair- 
fax and myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for 
he never lifted his head as we approached. 

“Here is Miss Eyre, sir,” said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way. He 
bowed, still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child. 

“Let Miss Eyre be seated,” said he; and there was something in the 
forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further 
to express, “What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or 
not? At this moment I am not disposed to accost her.” 

I sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished politeness 
would probably have confused me; I could not have returned or repaid 
it by answering grace and elegance on my part: but harsh caprice laid 
me under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the 
freak of manner, gave me the advantage. Besides, the eccentricity of 
the proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on. 

He went on as a statue would—that is, he neither spoke nor moved. 
Mrs. Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be am- 
fable, and she began to talk. Kindly, as usual—and, as usual, rather trite 
she condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; 
on the annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain; 
then she commended his patience and perseverance in going through 
with it. 

“Madam, I should like some tea,” was the sole rejoinder she got. 
She hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to 
arrange the cups, spoons, etc., with assiduous celerity. I and Adéle went 
to the table; but the master did not leave his couch. 

“Will you hand Mr. Rochester’s cup?” said Mrs. Fairfax to me; 
““Adéle might perhaps spill it.” 

T did as requested. As he took the cup from my hand, Adéle, think- 
ing the moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried 
out — 

“N’est~ce pas, monsieur, qu’il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre, 
dans votre petit coffre?” 

“Who talks of cadeaux?” said he gruffly. “Did you expect a present, 
Miss Eyre? Are you fond of presents?” and he searched my face with 
eyes that I saw were dark, irate, and piercing. 


JANE EYRE 103 


“I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are gen- 
erally thought pleasant things.” 

“Generally thought? But what do you think?” 

“I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an 
answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has 
it not? and one should consider all before pronouncing an opinion as to 
its nature.” 

“Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adéle: she demands a 
‘cadeau,’ clamorously, the moment she sees me; you beat about the 
bush.” 

“Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adéle has: she can 
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom, for 
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but 
if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger, 
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment.” 

“Oh, don’t fall back on over-modesty! I have examined Adéle, and 
find you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no 
talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement.” 

“Sir, you have now given me my ‘cadeau;’ I am obliged to you: it is 
the meed teachers most covet—praise of their pupils’ progress.” 

“Humph!” said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence. 

“Come to the fire,” said the master, when the tray was taken away, 
and Mrs, Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while 
Adéle was leading me by the hand around the room, showing me the 
beautiful books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonniéres. We 
obeyed, as in duty bound; Adéle wanted to take a seat on my knee, but 
she was ordered to amuse herself with Pilot. 

“You have been resident in my house three months?” 

“Yes, sir.” 


“And you came from ——?” 

“From Lowood school, in —-—shire.” 

“Ah, a charitable concern, How long were you there?” 
“Hight years.” 


“Bight years! you must be tenacious of life. I thought half the time 
in such a place would have done up any constitution! No wonder you 
have rather the look of another world. I marvelled where you had got 
that sort of face. When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I 
thought unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand 
whether you had bewitched my horse; I am not sure yet. Who are your 
parents?” 

“T have none.” 

“Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?” 

“No,* 


104 JANE EYRE 


“T thought not, And so you were waiting for your people when you 
sat on that stile?” 

“For whom, sir?” 

“For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them. 
Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned 
ice on the causeway?” 

I shook my head. “The men in green all forsook England a hundred 
years ago,” said I, speaking as seriously as he had done; “and not even 
in Hay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them. I 
don’t think either summer, or harvest, or winter moon will ever shine on 
their revels more.” 

Mrs, Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, 
seemed wondering what sort of talk this was. 

“Well,” resumed Myr, Rochester, “if you disown parents, you must 
have some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?” 

“No, none that I ever saw.” 

“And your home?” 

“T have none.” 

“Where do your brothers and sisters live?” 

“J have no brothers or sisters.” 

“Who recommended you to come here?” 

“T advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement.” 

“Yes,” said the good lady, who now knew what. ground we were upon, 
“and I am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make. 
Miss Eyre has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and care- 
ful teacher to Adéle.” 

“Don't trouble yourself to give her a character,” returned Mr. 
Rochester: “eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself. She 
began by felling my horse.” 

“Sire? said Mrs. Fairfax, 

“T have to thank her for this sprain.” 

The widow looked bewildered. 

“Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Have you seen much society?” 

“None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates 
of Thornfield.” 

“fave you read much?” 

“Only such books as came in my way, and they have not been numer 
ous or very learned.” 

“You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in 
religious forms;—Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a 
parson, is he not?” 


JANE EYRE 105 

“Yes, sir.” 

“And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of re- 
ligieuses would worship their director.” 

“Qh, no.” 

“You are very cool! No! What! a novice not worship her priest! 
That sounds blasphemous.” 

“TI disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling. He 
is a harsh man, at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair, and 
for economy’s sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we 
could hardly sew.” 

“That was very false economy,” remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now 
again caught the drift of the dialogue. 

“And was that the head and front of his offending?” demanded Mr. 
Rochester. 

“He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provi- 
sion department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us 
with long lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books 
of his own inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us 
afraid to go to bed.” 

“What age were you when you went to Lowood?” 

“About ten.” 

“And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?” 

I assented. 

“Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have 
been able to guess your age. It is a point difficult to fix where the 
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case. And 
now what did you learn at Lowood? Can you play?” 

“A little.” 

“Of course, that is the established answer, Go into the library—I 
mean, if you please-—(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 
‘Do this,’ and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one 
new inmate.)—Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave 
the door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune.” 

I departed, obeying his directions, 

“Enough!” he called out in a few minutes, “You play a little, I see; 
like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but 
not well.” 

I closed the piano and returned. Mr. Rochester continued,— 

“Adale showed me some sketches this morning, which she said were 
yours. I don’t know whether they were entirely of your doing; prob- 
ably a master aided you?” 

“No, indeed!” I interjected. 

“Ah! that pricks pride, Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can 


106 JANE EYRE 


vouch for its contents being original; but don’t pass your word unless 
you are certain: I can recognize patchwork.” 

“Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir.” 

I brought the portfolio from the library. 

“Approach the table,” said he; and I wheeled it to his couch. Adéle 
and Mrs, Fairfax drew near to see the pictures. 

“No crowding,” said Mr. Rochester: “take the drawings from my 
hand as I finish with them; but don’t push your faces up to mine.” 

He deliberately scrutinized each sketch and painting. Three he laid 
aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him. 

“Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,” said he, “and look 
at them with Adéle;—you” (glancing at me) “resume your seat, and 
answer my questions. I perceive these pictures were done by one hand; 
was that hand yours?” 

“Ves,” 

“And when did you find time to do them? They have taken much 
time, and some thought.” . 

“T did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had 
no other occupation.” 

“Where did you get your copies?” 

“Out of my head.” 

“That head I see now on your shoulders?” 

“Ves, sir.” 

“Has it other furniture of the same kind within?” 

“I should think it may have; I should hope—better.” 

He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alter- 
nately. 

While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are. And 
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful. The subjects 
had, indeed, risen vividly on my mind. As I saw them with the spiritual 
eye, before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my 
hand would not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out 
put a pale portrait of the thing I had conceived. 

These pictures were in water-colours. The first represented clouds 
low and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse; 
so, too, was the foreground—or rather, the nearest billows, for there 
was no land, One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, 
on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam; 
its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched with az 
brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering distinctness as 
my pencil could impart. Sinking below the bird and mast, a drowned 
corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only limb 
clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn. 


JANE EYRE 107 


The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a 
hill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze. Beyond and 
above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the 
sky was a woman’s shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft 
as I could combine. The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the 
lineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes 
shone dark and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud 
torn by storm or by electric travail. On the neck lay a pale reflection 
like moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds 
from which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star. 

The third showed the pinnacle of au iceberg piercing a polar winter 
sky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, 
along the horizon. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the fore- 
ground, a head—a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and rest- 
ing against it. Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and sup- 
porting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil; a brow quite 
bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning 
but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible. Above the temples, 
amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character 
and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with 
sparkles of a more lurid tinge. This pale crescent was “the likeness of a 
kingly crown;” what it diademed was “the shape which shape hag 
none,” 

“Were you happy when you painted these pictures?” asked Mr. 
Rochester presently. 

“I was absorbed, sir—yes, and I was happy. To paint them, in short, 
was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.” 

“That is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own account, 
have been few; but I dare say you did exist in a kind of artist’s dream- 
Jand while you blent and arranged these strange tints. Did you sit at 
them long each day?” 

“J had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at 
them from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the 
midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply.” 

“And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?” 

“Far from it, I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and 
my handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was 
quite powerless to realize.” 

“Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no 
more, probably. You had not enough of the artist’s skill and science to 
give it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar. As to 
the thoughts, they are elfish. These eyes in the Evening Star you must 
have seen in a dream. How could you make them look so clear, and yet 


108 JANE EYRE 


not at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays. And what 
meaning is that in their solemn depth? And who taught you to paint 
wind? There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top, Where did 
you see Latmos? For that is Latmos. There! put the drawings away!” 

I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his 
watch, he said abruptly, — 

“Tt is nine o’clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adéle sit 
up so long? Take her to bed.” 

Adéle went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the 
caress, but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, 
nor so much, 

“T wish you all good-night now,” said he, making a movement of the 
hand towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and 
wished to dismiss us. Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting; I took my 
portfolio; we curtsied to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so 
withdrew, 

“You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax,” 
I observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adéle to bed. 

“Well, is he?” 

“T think so; he is very changeful and abrupt.” 

“True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so ac- 
customed to his manner, I never think of it. And then, if he has pecu- 
liarities of temper, allowance should be made.” 

“Why?” 

“Partly because it is his nature—and we can none of us help our 
nature; and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass 
him, and make his spirits unequal.” 

“What about?” 

“Family troubles, for one thing.” 

“But he has no family.” 

“Not now, but he has had—or, at least, relatives. He lost his elder, 
brother a few years since.” 

“His elder brother?” 

“Yes, The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in pos- 
session of the property; only about nine years.” 

“Nine years is a tolerable time. Was he so very fond of his brother 
as to be still inconsolable for his loss?” 

“Why, no—perhaps not. I believe there were some misunderstand- 
ings between them, Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. 
Edward; and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him. The old 
gentleman was fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate 
together. He did not like to diminish the property by division; and yet 
he was anxious that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up 


SANE EVRE pdels) 


the consequence of the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps 
were taken that were not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief. 
Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward 
into what he considered a painful position, for the sake of making his 
fortune: what the precise nature of that position was I never clearly 
knew, but his spirit could not brook what he had to suffer in it. He is 
not very forgiving: he broke with his family, and now for many years 
he has led an unsettled kind of life. I don’t think he has ever been 
resident at Thornfield for a fortnight together, since the death of his 
brother without a will left him master of the estate; and, indeed, no 
wonder he shuns the old place.” 

“Why should he shun it?” 

“Perhaps he thinks it gloomy.” 

The answer was evasive. I should have liked something clearer; but 
Mrs. Fairfax either could not or would not give me more explicit in- 
formation of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester’s trials. She 
averred they were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was 
chiefly from conjecture. It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to 
drop the subject, which I did accordingly. 


CHAPTER XIV 


For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester. In the morn- 
ings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon, gen- 
tlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes 
stayed to dine with him. When his sprain was well enough to admit of 
horse exercise, he rode out a good deal—probably to return these visits, 
as he generally did not come back till late at night. 

During this interval, even Adéle was seldom sent for to his presence, 
and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional ren- 
contre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would some- 
times pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by 
a distant nod or a cold glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentle- 
manlike affability. His changes of mood did not offend me, because TI 
saw that I had nothing to do with their alteration; the ebb and flow de-’ 
pended on causes quite disconnected with me. 

One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my port 
folio; in order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went 
away early, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax in- 
formed me; but the night being wet and inclement, Mrp. Rochester did 
not accompany them. Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a 
message came that I and Adéle were to go downstairs. I brushed Adéle’s 


10 JANE EYRE 


hair and made her neat, and having ascertained that I was myself in my 
usual Quaker trim, where there was nothing to retouch—all being too 
close and plain, braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement—we 
descended, Adéle wondering whether the petit coffre was at length 
come; for, owing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been de- 
layed. She was gratified: there it stood, a little carton, on the table 
when we entered the dining-room. She appeared to’ know it by instinct. 

“Ma boite! ma boite!” exclaimed she, running towards it. 

“Ves, there is your ‘boite’ at last: take it into a corner, you genuine 
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,” said the 
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the 
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside. “And mind,” he con- 
tinued, “don’t bother me with any details of the anatomical process, or 
any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be con- 
ducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?” 

Adéle seemed scarcely to need the warning; she had already retired to 
a sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured 
the lid. Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery en- 
velopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed,— 

“Oh ciel! Que c’est beau!” and then remained absorbed in ecstatic 
contemplation. 

“Ts Miss Eyre there?” now demanded the master, half rising from his 
seat to look round to the door, near which I still stood. 

“Ah! well, come forward; be seated here.” He drew a chair near his 
own, “I am not fond of the pratile of children,” he continued; “for, old 
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associatiofis connected with their 
lisp. It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening téte-d-téie 
with a brat. Don’t draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre; sit down ex- 
actly where I placed it—if you please, that is. Confound these civilities! 
I continually forget them. Nor do I particularly affect simple-minded 
old ladies. By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind; it won’t do to neglect 
her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is said to be thicker than 
water.’ 

He rang, and dispatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon ar- 
tived, knitting-basket in hand. 

“Good-evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose. I 
have forbidden Adéle to talk to me about her presents, and she is burst- 
ing with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and in- 
terlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever per- 
formed.” 

Adéle, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax than she summoned her to 
her sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory,

the waxen contents of her “boite;” pouring out, meantime, explanations 
and raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of. 

“Now I have performed the part of a good host,” pursued Mr. Roch- 
ester, ‘put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be 
at liberty to attend to my own pleasure. Miss Eyre, draw your chair 
still a little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you 
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have 
no mind to do.” 

I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained some- 
what in the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving 
orders, it seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly. 

We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had 
been Jit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the 
large fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample 
before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the 
subdued chat of Adéle (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each 
pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes. 

Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked dif- 
ferent from what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern—much 
less gloomy. There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, 
whether with wine or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable. 
He was, in short, in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, 
and also more self-indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the 
morning: still he looked precisely grim, cushioning his massive head 
against the swelling back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire 
on his granite-hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had 
great, dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too—not without a certain change 
in their depths sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, 
at least, of that feeling. 

He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking 
the same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my 
gaze fastened on his physiognomy. 

“Vou examine me, Miss Eyre,” said he; “do you think me hand- 
some?” 

I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by some- 
thing conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped 
from my tongue before I was aware—‘“No, sir.” 

“Ah! By my word! there is something singular about you,” said he: 
“you have the air of a little nonnetie; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, 
as you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on 
the carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my 
face; as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or 
makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round 


112 JANE EYRE 


rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque. What do you mean 
by it?” 

“Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon. I ought to have replied that 
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about ap- 
pearances; that tastes differ; that beauty is of little importance, or 
something of that sort.” 

“You ought to have replied no such thing. Beauty of little conse- 
quence, indeed! And so, under pretence of softening the previous out- 
rage, of stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly pen- 
knife under my ear! Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray? I 
suppose I have all my limbs and all my features like any other man?” 

“Mr, Rochester, allow’me to disown my first answer. I intended no 
pointed repartee: it was only a blunder.” 

“Just so; I think so; and you shall be answerable for it. Criticise me: 
does my forehead not please you?” 

He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his 
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an 
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen. 

“Now, ma’am, am I a fool?” 

“Far from it, sir, You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in 
return whether you are a philanthropist?” 

“There again! Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to 
pat my head; and that is because I said I did not like the society of 
children and old women (low be it spoken!), No, young lady, I am not 
a general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;” and he pointed to the 
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which, for- 
tunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous, giving, indeed, a marked 
breadth to the upper part of his head; “and, besides, I once had a kind 
of rude tenderness of heart. When I was as old as you, I was a feeling 
fellow enough; partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky, But 
Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her 
knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an india- 
rubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with 
one sentient point in the middle of the lump, Yes; does that leave hope 
for me?” : 

“Hope of what, sir?” 

“Of my final re-transformation from india-rubber back to flesh?” 

“Decidedly he has had too much wine,” I thought; and I did not 
know what answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell 
whether he was capable of being re-transformed? 

“You look very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not 
pretty any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you: 
besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of ‘yours 


JANE EVRE 113 


away from my physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers 
of the rug; so puzzle on. Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious 
and communicative to-night.” 

With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning 
his arm on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen 
plainly as well as his face—his unusual breadth of chest, disproportion- 
ate almost to his length of limb. I am sure most people would have 
thought him an ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in 
his port, so much ease in his demeanour, such a look of complete indif- 
ference to his own external appearance, so haughty a reliance on the 
power of other qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack 
of mere personal attractiveness, that in looking at him one inevitably 
shared the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in 
the confidence, 

“I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night,” he re- 
peated, ‘‘and that is why IJ sent for you. The fire and the chandelier were 
not sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of 
these can talk. Adéle is a degree better, but still far below the mark; 
Mss, Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you 
puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here, I have almost for- 
gotten you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head: but to- 
night I am resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and re- 
call what pleases. It would please me now to draw you out—to learn 
more of you—therefore speak.” 

Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submis: 
sive smile either. 

“Speak,” he urged. 

“What about, sir?” 

“Whatever you like. I leave both the choice of subject and the man- 
ner of treating it entirely to yourself.” 

Accordingly I sat and said nothing. “If he expects me to talk for the 
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed him- 
self to the wrong person,” I thought. 

“You are dumb, Miss Eyre.” 

I was dumb still. He bent his head a little towards me, and with a 
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes. 

“Stubborn?” he said, “and annoyed? Ah! it is consistent. I put my 
request in an absurd, almost insolent form. Miss Eyre, I beg your par- 
don. The fact is, once for all, I don’t wish to treat you like an inferior— 
that is” (correcting himself), “I claim only such superiority as must re- 
sult from‘ twenty years’ difference in age and a century’s advance in ex- 
perience. This is legitimate, et j’y tzens, as Adéle would say; and it is by 
virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that I desire you to have the 


Lrg JANE EYRE 


goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert my thoughts, which are 
galled with dwelling on one point—cankering as a rusty nail.” 

He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel 
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so, 

“T am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir—quite willing; but I cannot 
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you? Ask 
me questions, and I will do my best to answer them.” 

“Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to 
be a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting sometimes, on the grounds 
E stated—namely, that 1 am old enough to be your father, and that I 
have battled through a varied experience with many men of many na- 
tions, and roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with 
one set of people in one house?” 

“Do as you please, sir.” 

“That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very 
evasive one. Reply clearly.” 

“J don’t think, sir, you have a right to command me merely because 
you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I 
have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of 
your time and experience.” 

“Humph! Promptly spoken. But I won’t allow that, seeing that it 
would never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a 
bad, use of both advantages. Leaving superiority out of the question, 
then, you must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without 
being piqued or hurt by the tone of command. Will you?” 

I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester és peculiar—he seems to 
forget that he pays me £30 per annum for receiving his orders, 

“The smile is very well,” said he, catching instantly the passing ex- 
pression; “but speak toc.” 

“T was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves 
to inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt 
by their orders.” 

“Paid subordinates! What! you are my paid subordinate, are you? 
Oh, yes, I had forgotten the salary! Well, then, on that mercenary 
ground, will you agree to let me hector a little?” 

“No, sir, not on that ground; but on the ground that you did forget it, 
and that you care whether or not a dependant is comfortable in his de- 
pendency, I agree heartily.” 

“And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional 
forms and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from 
insolence?” 

“T am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one 


JANE EYRE 115 


I rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a 
salary.” 

“Humbug! Most things free-born will submit to anything for a sal- 
ary; therefore keep to yourself, and don’t venture on generalities of 
which you are intensely ignorant. However, I mentally shake hands 
with you for your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the 
manner in which it was said, as for the substance of the speech: the man- 
ner was frank and sincere; one does not often see such 4 manner—no, on 
the contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misappre~ 
hension of one’s meaning is the usual reward of candour. Not three in 
three thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as 
you have just done. But I don’t mean to flatter you: if you are cast ina 
different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it. 
And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet know, 
you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable defects to 
counterbalance your few good points.” 

“And so may you,” I thought. My eye met his as the idea crossed my 
mind: he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been 
spoken as well as imagined. 

“Ves, yes, you are right,” said he; “I have plenty of faults of my own: 
I know it, and I don’t wish to palliate them, I assure you. God wot I 
need not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of 
deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might 
well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself. I 
started, or rather (for, like other defaulters, I like to lay half the blame 
on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong tack 
at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right course 
since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as good 
as you—wiser—almost as stainless. I envy you your peace of mind, 
your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory. Little girl, a memory 
without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure—an inex- 
haustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?” 

“Flow was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?” 

“All right then; limpid, salubrious; no gush of bilge water had turned 
it to fetid puddle. I was your equal at eighteen—quite your equal. Na- 
ture meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre—one of the 
better kind; and you see Iam not so. You would say you don’t see it; at 
least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, 
what you express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its lan 
guage). Then take my word for it, I am not a villain: you are not to 
suppose that—not to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, ow- 
ing, I verily believe, rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I 
am 4 trite, commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipa+

tions with which the rich and worthless try to put on life. Do you won- 
der that I avow this to you? Know, that in the course of your future life 
you will often find yourself elected the involuntary confidant of your ac- 
quaintances’ secrets: people will instinctively find out, as I have done, 
that it is not your forte to talk of yourself, but to listen while others talk 
of themselves: they will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent 
scorn of their indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the 
less comforting and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its 
manifestations.” 

“How do you know?—how can you guess all this, sir?” 

“T know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were writ- 
ing my thoughts in a diary. You would say, I should have been superior 
to circumstances: so I should—so I should; but you see I was not. 
When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned 
desperate; then I degenerated. Now, when any vicious simpleton excites 
my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am bet- 
ter than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level. I wish 
I had stood firm—God knows I do! Dread remorse when you are 
tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life.” 

“Repentance is said to be its cure, sir.” 

“It is not its cure. Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform 
—I have strength yet for that—if—but where is the use of thinking 6f 
it, hampered, buxdened, cursed as I am? Besides, since happiness is irre- 
vocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life; and I will 
get it, cost what it may.” 

“Then you will degenerate still more, sir.” 

“Possibly; yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure? And 
I may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the 
moor.” 

“Tt will sting—it will taste bitter, sir.” 

“How do you knowP—you never tried it. How very serious--how 
very solemn you look; and you are as ignorant of the matter as this 
cameo head” (taking one from the mantelpiece). “You have no right to 
preach to me, you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and 
are absolutely unacquainted with its mysteries.” 

“I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought 
remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence.” 

“And who talks of error now? I scarcely think the notion that flit- 
tered across my brain was an error. I believe it was an inspiration rath- 
er than a temptation; it was very genial, very soothing—I know that. 
Here it comes again! It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put 
on the robes of an angel of light. I think I must admit so fair a guest 
when it asks entrance to my heart.” 


JANE EYRE 117 


“Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.” 

“Once more, how do you know? By what instinct do you pretend to 
distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from 
the eternal throne—between a guide and a seducer?” 

“T judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said 
the suggestion had returned upon you. I feel sure it will work you more 
misery if you listen to it.” 

“Not at all—it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the 
rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don’t make yourself uneasy. 
Here, come in, bonny wanderer!” 

He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own; 
then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest, he 
seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being. 

“Now,” he continued, again addressing me, “I have received the pil- 
grim—a disguised deity, as I verily believe. Already it has done me 
good: my heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine.” 

“To speak truth, sir, I don’t understand you at all: IJ cannot keep up 
the conversation, because it has got out of my depth. Only one thing, I 
know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that 
you regretted your own imperfection;—one thing I can comprehend: 
you intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane. It 
seems to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to 
become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you 
began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in 
a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, te 
which you might revert with pleasure.” 

“Justly thought—rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I] am 
paving hell with energy.” 

“Sire? 

“IT am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint, 
Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have 
been.” 

“And better?” 

“And better—-so much better as pure ore is than foul dross. You 
seem to doubt me; I don’t doubt myself; I know what my aim is, what 
my motives are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of 
the Medes and Persians, that both are right.” 

“They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalize them.” 

“They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute: 
unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules.” 

“That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir, because one can see at once that 
it is liable to abuse,” 


118 JANE EYRE 


“Sententious sage! so it is; but E swear by my household gods not to 
abuse it.” 
, “You are human and fallible.” 
» “Tam; so are you—what then?” 
(\ “The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the 
| ‘divine and perfect alone can be safely entrusted.” 
‘. “What power?” 
\ \ «That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action, ‘Let it be 
\right. ” 

“Tet it be right’-—the very words; you have pronounced them.” 

“May it be right, then,” I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to con- 
tinue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible 
that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration—at 
least, beyond its present reach—and feeling the uncertainty, the vague 
sense of insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance, 

“Where are you going?” 

“To put Adéle to bed; it is past her bedtime.” 

“Vou are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphinx.” 

“Your language is enigmatical, sir; but though I am bewildered, I am 
certainly not afraid.” 

“You are afraid—your self-love dreads a blunder.” 

“In that sense I do feel apprehensive; I have no wish to talk 
nonsense.” 

“Tf you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mis- 
take it for sense. Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre? Don’t trouble your- 
self to answer—I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: 
believe me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally 
vicious. The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling 
your features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you 
fear in the presence of a man and a brother—or father, or master, or 
what you will—to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly. 
But, in time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, ag I find it im- 
possible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and move- 
ments will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now. I 
see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set 
bars of a cage—a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there: were it but 
free, it would soar cloud-high. You are still bent on going?” 

“Tt has struck nine, sir.” 

“Never mind—wait a minute: Adéle is not ready to go to bed yet. My 
position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room, 
favours observation. While talking to you, I have also occasionally 
Watched Adéle (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious study 
reasons that I may, nay, that I shall impart to you some day). She 


JANE EYRE It9 


pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk frock: rap- 
ture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her blood, blends 
with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones. ‘Il faut que je 
Fessaie!’ cried she, ‘et & instant méme!’ and she rushed out of the room. 
She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in a few minutes 
she will re-enter; and J know what I shall see—a miniature of Céline 
Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the rising of —~ But 
never mind that. However, my tenderest feelings are about to receive a 
shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it will be 
realized.” 

Ere long, Adéle’s little foot was heard tripping across the hall. She 
entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted. A dress of rose- 
coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be gathered, 
replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of rosebuds 
circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings and smal] 
white satin sandals. 

“Est-ce que ma robe va bien?” cried she, bounding forwards; “et mes 
souliers? et mes bas? Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!” 

And spreading out her dress, she chasséed across the room; till, having 
reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tiptoe, 
then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming — 

“Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonté;” then rising, 
she added, “C’est comme cela que maman faisait, n’est-ce pas, 
monsieur?” 

“Pre-cise-ly!” was the answer; “and ‘comme cela’ she charmed my 
English gold out of my British breeches pocket. I have been green, too, 
Miss Eyre—ay, grass green; not a more vernal tint freshens you now 
than once freshened me. My spring is gone, however, but it has left me 
that French floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain 
be rid of. Not valuing now the root whence it sprang, having found that, 
it was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but 
half a liking to the blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just 
now. I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of ev- 
piating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work. I'll explain all 
this some day, Good-night.” 


CHAPTER XV 


Mr. Rocuester did, on'a future occasion, explain it. It was one after- 
noon, when he chanced to meet me and Adéle in the grounds; and while 
she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and 
down a long beech avenue within sight of her. 


120 JANE EYRE 


He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Cé- 
line Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a 
“grande passion.” This passion Céline had professed to return with even 
superior ardour. He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was; he be- 
lieved, as he said, that she preferred his “taille d’athléte” to the elegance 
of the Apollo Belvidere. 

“And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the 
Gallic sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in a hotel; gave 
her a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, dia- 
monds, dentelles, etc. In short, I began the process of ruining myself in 
the received style, like any other spoony. I had not, it seems, the origin- 
ality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trod the old 
track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the beaten cen- 
tre, I had—as I deserved to haye—the fate of all other spoonies. Hap- 
pening to call one evening when Céline did not expect me, I found her 
out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling through 
Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir, happy to breathe the air consecrated 
so lately by her presence. No—I exaggerate; I never thought there was 
any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort of pastille per- 
fume she had left, a scent of musk and amber, than an odour of sanctity. 
I was just peginning to stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and 
sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to open the window and 
step out on to the balcony. It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and 
very still and serene. The balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I 
sat down, and took out a cigar,—I will take one now, if you will excuse 
me.” 

Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar, 
Having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on 
the freezing and sunless air, he went on,— 

“T liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was croquant— 
(overlook the barbaxism)—croguant chocolate comfits, and smoking al- 
ternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along the fash- 
ionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an elegant 
tlose carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and distinctly 
seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognized the vozture I had given Cé- 
line. She was returning: of course my heart thumped with impatience 
against the iron rails I leant upon. The carriage stopped, as I had ex- 
pected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an opera 
inamorata) alighted: though muffled in a cloak—an unnecessary encum- 
brance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening—I knew her instantly by 
her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress as she skipped 
from the carriage step. Bending over the balcony, I was about to mur- 
mur ‘Mon ange’—in a, tone, of course, which should be audible to the eax 


JANE EYRE 121 


of love alone—when a figure jumped from the carriage after her; 
cloaked also: but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pave- 
ment, and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched 
porte cochére of the hotel. 

“You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre? Of course not; I need 
not ask you, because you never felt love. You have both sentiments yet 
to experience; your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall 
waken it. You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in 
which your youth has hitherto slid away. Floating on with closed eyes 
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the 
bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base. But I tell you 
—and you may mark my words—you will come some day to a craggy 
pass in the channel, where the whole of life’s stream will be broken up 
into whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to 
atoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave 
into a calmer current—as I am now. 

“T like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and still- 
ness of the world under this frost. I like Thornfield, its antiquity, its 
retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its gray facade and lines 
of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: ahd yet how long have I 
abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great plague-houseP 
How I do still abhor——” 

He ground his teeth and was silent; he arrested his step and struck his 
boot against the hard ground. Some hated thought seemed to have him 
in its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance. 

We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was be- 
fore us. Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare suck 
as I never saw before or since. Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust, de- 
testation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large 
pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow. Wild was the wrestle which 
should be paramount. But another feeling rose and triumphed: some- 
thing hard and cynical, self-willed and resolute; it settled his passion and 
petrified his countenance. He went on:—~ 

“During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point 
with my destiny. She stood there, by that beech-trunk—a hag like one 
of those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres. *You like 
Thornfield?’ she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air a 
memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front, be- 
tween the upper and lower row of windows, ‘Like it if you can! Like it 
if you dare!’ 

“I will like it, said I; ‘I dare like it;’ and” (he subjoined moodily) 
“JT will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to goodness 
~-yes, goodness, I wish to be a better man than I have been, than 1 am: 


122 JANE EYRE 


as Job’s leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the habergeon, hin- 
drances which others count as iron and brass I will esteem but straw and 
rotten wood.” 

Adéle here ran before him with her shuttlecock. ‘“‘Away!” he cried 
harshly; “keep at a distance, child, or go in to Sophie!” Continuing then 
to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point 
whence he had abruptly diverged. 

“Did you leave the balcony, sir,” I asked, “when Mdlle. Varens 
entered?” 

T almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question; but, on 
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes 
towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow. “Oh, I had for- 
gotten Céline! Well, to resume. When I saw my charmer thus come in 
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake 
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided 
within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart’s core, 
Strange!” he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point— 
“strange that I should choose you for the confidante of all this, young 
lady; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were 
the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his 
opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you! But the last 
singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with your 
gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient of 
secrets. Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in communi- 
cation with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection; it is a 
peculiar mind; it is a unique one, Happily I do not mean to harm it; but 
if I did, it would not take harm from me. The more you and I converse, 
the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me,” After 
this digression, he proceeded :-— 

“JT remained in the balcony. ‘They will come to her boudoir, no 
doubt,’ thought I; ‘let me prepare an ambush.’ So putting my hand in 
through the open window I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an 
opening through which I could take observations; then I closed the case- 
ment, all but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers’ 
whispered vows. Then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the 
pair came in. My eye was quickly at the aperture. Céline’s chamber- 
maid entered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew. The couple 
were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there 
was 'the Varens,’ shining in satin and jewels—my gifts, of course—and 
there was her companion in an officer’s uniform; and I knew him for a 
young roué of a’ vicomte—a brainless and vicious youth whom I had 
sometimes met in society, and had never thought of hating because I 
despised him so absolutely. On recognizing him, the fang of the snake 


JANE EYRE 123 


jealousy was instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for 
Céline sank under an extinguisher. A woman who could betray me for 
such a rival was not worth contending for; she deserved only scormm— 
less, however, than I, who had been her dupe. 

“They began to talk. Their conversation eased me completely: frivo- 
lous, mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to 
weary than enrage a listener. A card of mine lay on the table; this being 
perceived, brought my name under discussion. Neither of them pos- 
sessed energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as 
coarsely as they could in their little way—especially Céline, who even 
waxed rather brilliant on my personal defects—deformities, she termed 
them. Now it had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration 
of what she called my ‘beauté mdle:’ wherein she differed diametrically 
from you, who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did 
not think me handsome. The contrast struck me at the time, and——” 

Adéle here came running up again. 

“Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and 
wishes to see you.” 

“Ah! in that case I must abridge. Opening the window, I walked in 
upon them; liberated Céline from my protection; gave her notice to va~ 
cate her hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregard- 
ed screams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an ap- 
pointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne. Next 
morning I had the pleasure of encountering him, left a bullet in one of 
his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and 
then thought I had done with the whole crew. But unluckily the Varens, 
six months before, had given me this filette Adéle, who, she affirmed, was 
my daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such 
grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than 
she. Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her 
child, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer. I acknowledged 
no natural claim on Adéle’s part to be supported by me, nor do I now 
acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite 
destitute, I e’en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris, 
and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an 
English country garden. Mrs, Fairfax found you to train it; but now 
you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you 
will perhaps think differently of your post and protégée: you will be 
coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place 
——that you beg me to look out for a new governess, etc—Eh?” 

“No; Adéle is not answerable for either her mother’s faults or yours. 
T have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense, parent- 
less—forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir—I shall cling 


124 JANE EYRE 


closer to her than before. How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet of 
a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a lone- 
ly little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?” 

“Oh, that is the light in which you view it! Well, I must go in now; 
and you too—it darkens.” 

But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adéle and Pilot—ran a race 
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock. When we 
went in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; 
kept her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked—not rebuking 
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to stray 
when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of charac- 
ter, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an English 
mind, Still she had her merits, and I was disposed to appreciate all that 
was good in her to the utmost. I sought in her countenance and features 
a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none—no trait, no turn of ex- 
pression announced relationship. It was a pity: if she could but have 
been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her. 

It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night, 
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me. As he had 
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of 
the narrative itseli—a wealthy Englishman’s passion for a French 
dancer, and her treachery to him, were everyday matters enough, no 
doubt, in society; but there was something decidedly strange in the 
paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the 
act of expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly- 
revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs. I meditated wonder- 
ingly on this incident, but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the 
present inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master’s man- 
ner to myself. The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed 
a tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such. His de- 
portment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than 
at the first. I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling 
hauteur; when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; 
he had always a word and sometimes a smile for me. When summoned 
by formal invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of 
reception that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, 
and that these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure 
as for my benefit. 

I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish. 
It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind un- 
acquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not 
mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their in- 
terest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange novelty 


JANE EYRE 125 


by which they were characterized) ; and I had a keen delight in receiving 
the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he portrayed, and 
following him in thought through the new regions he disclosed, never 
startled or troubled by one noxious allusion. 

The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint; the friendly 
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to 
him. I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master. 
Yet he was imperious sometimes still: but I did not mind that; I saw it 
was his way. So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest 
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred; my thin crescent- 
destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled up; my 
bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength. 

And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude, 
and many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the ob- 
ject I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than 
the brightest fire. Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not, 
for he brought them frequently before me. He was proud, sardonic, 
harsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that 
his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others. 
He was moody, too—unaccountably so. I more than once, when sent for 
to read to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent 
on his folded arms; and when he looked up, a morose, almost a malig- 
nant scowl blackened his features. But I believed that his moodiness, his 
harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say former, for now he 
seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate. 
T believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles, 
and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education 
instilled, or destiny encouraged. I thought there were excellent materials 
in him, though for the present they hung together somewhat spoiled and 
tangled. I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, 
and would have given much to assuage it. 

Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, 
I could not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, 
and told how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be 
happy at Thornfield. 

“Why not?” I asked myself. “What alienates him from the house? 
Will he leave it again soon? Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here 
longer than a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight 
weeks. If he does go, the change will be doleful. Suppose he should be 
absent spring, summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days 
will seem!” 

TY hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any 
rate, I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and ‘lu- 


126 JANE EYRE 


gubrious, which sounded, I thought, just above me. I wished I had kept 
my candle burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were de- 
pressed. I rose and sat up in bed, listening. The sound was hushed. 

T tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously, my inward tran- 
quillity was broken. The clock, far down in the hall, struck two. Just 
then it seemed my chamber-door was touched, as if fingers had swept the’ 
panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside, J said, “Who is © 
there?” Nothing answered. I was chilled with fear. 

All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitch- 
en-door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to 
the threshold of Mr. Rochester’s chamber: I had seen him lying there 
myself in the mornings. The idea calmed me somewhat: I Jay down. 
Silence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned 
again through the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber. 
But it was not fated that I should sleep that night. A dream had scarce- 
ly approached my ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freez- 
ing incident enough. 

This was a demoniac laugh—low, suppressed, and deep—uttered, as 
it seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door. The head of my bed 
was near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my 
bedside—or rather, crouched by my pillow. But I rose, looked round, 
and could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was 
reiterated, and I knew it came from behind the panels. My first impulse 
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, “Who is 
there?” 

Something gurgled and moaned. Fre long, steps retreated up the gal- 
lery towards the third-story staircase: a door had lately been made to 
shut in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still. 

“Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?” thought I. 
Impossible now to remain longer by myself; I must go to Mrs. Fairfax. 
I burried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the 
door with a trembling hand. There was a candle burning just outside, 
left on the matting in the gallery, I was surprised at this circumstance: 
but still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with 
smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence 
these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of 
burning. 

Something creaked: it was a door ajat; and that door was Mr. Ro- 
chester’s, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence. I thought no 
more of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: 
in an instant I was within the chamber. Tongues of flame darted round 
the bed; the curtains were on fire. In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. 
Rochester lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep, 


JANE EYRE 127 


“Wake! wakel” I cried. I shook him, but he only murmured and 
turned: the smoke had stupefied him. Not a moment could be lost; the 
very sheets were kindling. I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, 
one was wide and the other deep, and both were filled with water. I 
heaved them up, deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own 
room, brought my own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by 
God’s aid, succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it. 

The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I 
flung from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of 
the shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last. 
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake, because I heard him ful- 
tminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of water. 

“Ts there a flood?” he cried. 

“No, sir,” I answered; “but there has been a fire. Get up, do; you are 
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle.” 

“In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?” he 
demanded. ‘‘What have you donc with me, witch, sorceress? Who is in 
the room besides you? Have you plotted to drown me?” 

“I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven’s name, get up. Some- 
body has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what 
it is.” 

“There! I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet. Wait 
two minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be—yes, 
here is my dressing-gown, Now run!” 

I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery. He 
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened 
and scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water. 

“What is it? and who did it?” he asked. 

I briefly related to him what had transpired: the strange laugh I had 
heard in the gallery; the step ascending to the third story; the smoke— 
the smell of fire which had conducted me to his room; in what state I 
had found matters there, and how I had deluged him with all the water 
I could lay hands on. 

He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more con- 
cern than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had 
concluded. 

“Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?” I asked. 

“Mrs, Fairfax? No; what the deuce would you call her for? What 
can she do? Let her sleep unmolested.” 

“Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife.” 

“Not at all; just be still. You have a shawl on. If you are not warm 
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down 
in the arm-chair: there—I will put it on. Now place your feet on the 


128 JANE EYRE 


stool, to keep them out of the wet. I am going to leave you a few min- 
utes. I shall take the candle. Remain where you are till I return; be as 
still as a mouse. I must pay a visit to the second story. Don’t move, 
remember, or call any one.” 

He went. 1 watched the light withdraw. He passed up the gallery 
very softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible, 
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished. I was left in total darkness. 
I listened for some noise, but heard nothing. A very long time elapsed. 
I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then I did not see 
the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house. I was on the point of 
risking Mr. Rochester’s displeasure by disobeying his orders, when the 
light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I heard his un- 
shod feet tread the matting. “I hope it is he,” thought I, “and not some- 
thing worse.” 

He re-entered, pale and very gloomy. “I have found it all out,” said 
he, setting his candle down on the washstand; “it is as I thought.” 

“How, sir?” 

He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the 
ground. At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar 
tone,-— 

“T forgot whether you said you saw anything when you opened your 
chamber door.” 

“No, sir; only the candlestick on the ground.” 

“But you heard an odd laugh? You have heard that laugh before, I 
should think, or something like it?” 

“Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole—-she 
laughs in that way. She is a singular person.” 

“Just so. Grace Poole—you have guessed it. She is, as you say, sin- 
gular—very. Well, I shall reflect on the subject. Meantime, I am glad 
that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the precise 
details of to-night’s incident. You are no talking fool: say nothing about 
it. I will account for this state of affairs” (pointing to the bed): “and 
now return to your own room. I shall do very well on the sofa in the 
library for the rest of the night. It is near four:—-in two hours the ser- 
vants will be up.” 

“Good-night, then, sir,” said-I, departing. 

He seemed surprised—very inconsistently so, as he had just told me 
to go. 

“What!” he exclaimed, “are you quitting me already, and in that 
way?” 

“You said I might go, sir.” 

“But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of acknowl- 
edgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion, Why, 


JANE EYRE 129 


you have saved my life!—snatched me from a horrible and excruciating 
death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers! At least 
shake hands.” 

He held out his hand. I gave him mine: he took it first in one, then in 
both his own. 

“You have saved my life. I have a pleasure in owing you so immense 
a debt. I cannot say more. Nothing else that has being would have been 
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but 
you! it is different ;—I feel your benefits no burden, Jane.’ 

He paused; gazed at me; words almost visible trembled on his lips, — 
but his voice was checked. 

“Good-night again, sir. There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation, 
in the case.” 

“T knew,” he continued, “you would do me gogd in some way, at some 
time. I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression and 
smile did not”—(again he stopped)—‘“did not” (he proceeded hastily) 
“strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing. People talk of 
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of 
truth in the wildest fable. My cherished preserver, good-night!” 

Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look. 

“T am glad I happened to be awake,” I said; and then I was going. 

“What! you will gor” 

“T am cold, sir.” 7 

“Cold? Yes-—and standing in a pool! Go, then, Jane; go!” But he 
still retained my hand, and I could not free it. I bethought myself of an 
expedient. 

“T think I hear Mrs, Fairfax move, sir,” said I. 

“Well, leave me:” he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone. 

I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep. Till morning dawned 
I was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble 
rolled under surges of joy. I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild 
waters a shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshen~ 
ing gale, wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the 
beurne. But I could not reach it, even in fancy; a counteracting breeze 
blew off land, and continually drove me back. Sense would resist de- 
lirium; judgment would warn passion. Too feverish to rest, I rose as 
soon as day dawned. 


CHAPTER XVI 
I sors wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which fol- 


lowed this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to 
meet his eye. During the early part of the morning, I momentarily ex- 


130 JANE EYRE 


pected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the 
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had 
the impression that he was sure to visit it that day. 

But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt 
the quiet course of Adéle’s studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard 
some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester’s chamber, Mrs. 
Fairfax’s voice, and Leah’s, and the cook’s—that is, John’s wife—and 
even John’s own gruff tones. There were exclamations of “What a mer- 
cy master was not burnt in his bed!” “It is always dangerous to keep a 
candle lit at night!” “low providential that he had presence of mind to 
think of the water-jug!” “I wonder he waked nobody!” “It is to be 
hoped he will not take cold with sleeping on the library sofa!” etc. 

To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to 
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw 
through the open door that all was again restored to complete order— 
only the bed was stripped of its hangings. Leah stood up in the window- 
seat, rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke. I was about to ad- 
dress her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the af- 
fair; but, on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber—a woman 
sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains. That 
woman was no other than Grace Poole. 

There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff 
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap. She was intent on 
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard 
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the 
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the 
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose in- 
tended victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed) 
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate. I was amazed— 
confounded. She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start, no in- 
crease or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of guilt, or 
fear of detection. She said, “Good morning, Miss,” in her usual phleg- 
matic and brief manner, and taking up another ring and more tape, went 
on with her sewing. 

“T will put her to some test,” thought I: “such absolute impenetra- 
bility is past comprehension.” 

“Good morning, Grace,” I said. “Has anything happened here? I 
thought I heard the servants all talking together a while ago.” 

“Qnly master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep 
with his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he 
awoke before the bed-clothes or the woodwork caught, and contrived to 
quench the flames with the water in the ewer.” 


JANE EYRE ' 431 


“A strange affair!” I said, in a low voice; then, looking at her fixedly, 
“Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody? Did no one hear him move?” 

She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of 
consciousness in their expression. She seemed to examine me warily; 
then she answered, — 

“The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be 
likely to hear. Mrs. Fairfax’s room and yours are the nearest to mas- 
ter’s; but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, 
they often sleep heavy.” She paused, and then added, with a sort of as- 
sumed indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone, “But you 
are young, Miss, and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have 
heard a noiser” 

“T did,” said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polish- 
ing the panes, could not hear me, “and at first I thought it was Pilot. 
But Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange 
one.” 

She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her 
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure,—~ 

“It is hardly likely master would Jaugh, I should think, Miss, when he 
was in such danger: you must have been dreaming.” 

“T was not dreaming,” I said, with some warmth, for her brazen cool- 
ness provoked me. Again she looked at me, and with the same scrutin- 
izing and conscious eye. 

“Have you told master that you heard a laugh?” she inquired. 

“T have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning.” 

“Vou did not think of opening your door and looking out into the gal- 
lery?” she further asked. 

She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me 
information unawares. The idea struck me that if she discovered J knew 
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing off some of her malignant 
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard. 

“On the contrary,” said I, “I bolted my door.” 

“Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before 
you get into bed?” 

“Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans ac- 
cordingly!” Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied sharp- 
ly, “Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt; I did not think it 
necessary. I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be dreaded 
at Thornfield Hall, But in future” (and I laid marked stress on the 
words) “I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to 
lie down,” 

“It will be wise so to do,” was her answer: “this neighbourhood is as 
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by 


132 JANE EYRE 


robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds’ 
worth of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known, And you see, for 
such a Jarge house, there are very few servants, because master has never 
lived here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs lit- 
tle waiting on. But I always think it best to err on the safe side: a door 
is soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and 
any mischief that may be about. A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting 
all to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means, 
though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly.” And here 
she closed her harangue—a long one for her, and uttered with the de- 
mureness of a Quakeress. 

I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her 
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the 
cook entered. 

“Mrs, Poole,” said she, addressing Grace, “the servants’ dinner will 
soon be ready: will you come down?” 

“No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and ll 
carry it upstairs.” 

“Vou'll have some meat?” 

“Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that’s all.” 

“And the sago?” 

“Never mind it at present. I shall be coming down before tea-time: 
I'll make it myself.” 

The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for 
me; so I departed. 

I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax’s account of the curtain conflagration 
during dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the 
enigmatical character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the 
problem of her position at Thornfield, and questioning why she had not 
been given into custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed 
from her master’s service. He had almost as much as declared his con- 
viction of her criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld 
him from accusing her? Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy? It 
was strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow 
in the power of one of the meanest of his dependants; so much in her 
power, that even when she lifted her hand against his life, he dared not 
openly charge her with the attempt, much less punish her for it. 

Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to 
think that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Ro- 
chester in her behalf; but hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the 
idea could not be admitted. “Vet,” I reflected, “she has been young 
once; her youth would be contemporary with her master’s—Mrs, Fair- 
fax told me once she had lived here many years. I don’t think she can 


JANE EYRE 133 


ever have been pretty; but, for aught I know, she may possess original- 
ity and strength of character to compensate for the want of personal ad- 
vantages. Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: 
Grace is eccentric at least. What if a former caprice (a freak very pos- 
sible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into 
her power, and she now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the 
result of his own indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not 
disregard?” But, having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole’s 
square, flat figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so dis- 
tinctly to my mind’s eye that I thought, “No; impossible! my supposi- 
tion cannot be correct. Yet,” suggested the secret voice which talks to 
us in our own hearts, “you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. 
Rochester approves you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; 
and last night—remember his words, remember his look, remember his 
voice!” 

I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the mo- 
ment vividly renewed. I was now in the schoolroom; Adéle was draw- 
ing; I bent over her and directed her pencil. She looked up with a sort 
of start. 

“Qu’avez-vous, mademoiselle?” said she. “Vos doigts tremblent com- 
me la feuille, et vos joues sont rouges—mais, rouges comme des cerises!” 

“T am hot, Adéle, with stooping!’ She went on sketching; I went on 
thinking, 

I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been con- 
ceiving respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me. I compared myself 
with her, and found we were different. Bessie Leaven had said I was 
quite a lady; and she spoke truth—I was a lady. And now TI looked 
much better than I did when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and 
more flesh, more life, more vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and 
keener enjoyments. 

“Evening approaches,” said I, as I looked towards the window. “I 
have never heard Mr. Rochester’s voice or step in the house to-day; but 
surely I shall see him before night, I feared the meeting in the morn- 
ing; now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it 
is grown impatient.” 

When dusk actually closed, and when Adéle left me to go and play in 
the nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it. I listened for the 
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I 
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester’s own tread, and I turned to 
the door, expecting it to open and admit him, The door remained shut; 
darkness only came in through the window. Still it was not late; he often 
sent for me at seven and eight o’clock, and it was yet but six. Surely I 
should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many things 


134 JANE EYRE 


to say to him! I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace Poole, 
and to hear what he would answer: I wanted to ask him plainly if he 
really believed it was she who had made last night’s hideous attempt; 
and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret. It little mattered wheth- 
er my curiosity irritated him. I knew the pleasure of vexing and sooth- 
ing him by turns. It was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure instinct 
always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of provoca- 
tion I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill. 
Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my station, 
T could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy restraint: this 
suited both him and me. 

A tread creaked on the stairs at last. Leah made her appearance; but 
it was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax’s room. 
Thither I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I 
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester’s presence. 

“Vou must want your tea,” said the good lady, as I joined her; “you 
ate so little at dinner, I am afraid,” she continued, “you are not well to- 
day; you look flushed and feverish.” 

“Oh, quite well! I never felt better.” 

“Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite. Will you fill 
the tea-pot while I knit off this needle?” Having completed her task, she 
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I 
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast 
deepening into total obscurity. 

“It is fair to-night,” said she, as she looked through the panes, “though 
not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for 
his journey.” 

“Journey !—Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere? I did not know he was 
out.” 

“Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted. He is gone to the 
Leas, Mr. Eshton’s place, ten miles on the other side Millcote. I believe 
there is quite a party assembled there—Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn, 
Colonel Dent, and others.” 

“Do you expect him back to-night?” 

“No—nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a 
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are 
so stirrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can 
please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate. Gentlemen es- 
pecially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is so 
talented and 50 lively in society, that I believe he is a general favourite. 
The ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think his appear- 
ance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes: but I sup- 


JANE EVRE 


pose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and; 
make amends for any little fault of look.” | 

“Are there ladies at the Lease” ‘ 

“There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters—very elt 
ladies indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and M, 
most beautiful women, I; suppose: indeed I have seen Bla. 
seven years since, when/she was a girl of eighteen. She came 
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave. You should hav 
dining-room that dayl_how richly it was decorated, how brill 
up! I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen presen. 
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the v. 
the evening.” t 

“You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax; what was she like?” 

“Yes, I saw héy, The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as 
il was Christing’s-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, 
to hear some Of the ladies sing and play. Mr. Rochester would have me 
to come in, 44d I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them, I never 
saw @ more ®plendid scene: the ladics were magnificently dressed; most 
of them—at least most of the younger ones—looked handsome, but Miss 
Ingram wafs certainly the queen.” 

“And what was she like?” 

“Tall F fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck; olive com- 
plexion/ dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr, Rochester’s 
—largie and black, and as brilliant as her jewels. And then she had such 
a fin head of bair—raven-black, and so becomingly arranged; a crown 
of tick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest curls I ever 
sawh, She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf was passed 
ower her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and descending 
Inj long, fringed ends below her knee. She wore an amber-coloured 
fl'pwer, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the jetty mass of her 
ct pris,” 

reShe was greatly admired, of course?” 

\ “Yes, indeed; and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplish- 
N nents. She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied 
b yer on the piano, She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet.” 

+ “Mr. Rochester? I was not aware he could sing.” 

‘ “Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music,” 

, “And Miss Ingram—what sort of a voice had she?” 

\ “A very rich and powerful one. She sang delightfully; it was a treat to 
] jisten {0 her: and she played aflerwards. I am no judge of music, but

do; I am too thirsty to eat. Will you let me have another cup?” 

I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr. 
Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adéle came in, and the con- 
versation was turned into another channel. 

When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked 
into my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to 
bring back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagina- 
tion’s boundless and tractless waste, into the safe fold of common sense. 

Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the 
hopes, wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last nigh‘—~of the 
general state of mind in which IJ had indulged for nearly a fortnight 
past; Reason having come forward and told, in her own quiet way, a 
plain, unvamished tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly 
devoured the ideal;—I pronounced judgment to this effect :— 

That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of 
life; that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet — 
and swallowed poison as if it were nectar. 

“Vou,” I said, “a favourite with Mr. Rochester? You gifted with ie 
power of pleasing him? You of importance to him in any way? Gp! 
your folly sickens me, And you have derived pleasure from occasior.al 
tokens of preferencce—equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family 
and a man of the world to a dependant and a novice. How dared your?

superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in 
all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned 
and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and 
responded to, must lead. ignis-fatuus-like, into miry wilds whence there 
is nn extrication, 


JANE EYRE 137 


“Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow place the glass 
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without soft- 
ening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing irregu- 
larity; write under it, ‘Portrait of a Governess, disconnected, poor, and 

Jain.’ 

. “Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory—you have one prepared in 
your drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest 
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully 
the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and 
sweetest hues, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of 
Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;—what! 
you revert to Mr. Rochester as a model! Order! No snivel!—no senti~ 
ment!—no regret! I will endure only sense and resolution. Recall the 
august yel harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the 
round and dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither 
diamond ring nor gold bracelet; portray carefully the attire, aerial lace 
and glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it ‘Blanche, an 
accomplished Lady of rank.’ 

“Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester 
thinks well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 
‘Mr. Rochester might probably win that noble lady’s love, if he chose to 
strive for it: is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this indigent 
and insignificant plebeian?’ ” 

“T'll do it,” I resolved; and having framed this determination, I grew 
calm, and fell asleep. 

I kept my word. An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in 
crayons; and in Jess than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature 
of an imaginary Blanche Ingram. It looked a lovely face enough, and 
when compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as 
self-control could desire. I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my 
head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new 
impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart. 

Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of whole- ° 
some discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit. 
Thanks to it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent 
calm, which, had they found me unprepared, I should probably have 
been unequal to maintain, even externally. 


CHAPTER XVII 


A WEEK passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester; ten days, and 
still he did not come. Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he 


138 JANE EYRE 


were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Contin- 
ent, and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he 
had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unex- 
pected. When I heard this, J was beginning to feel a strange chill and 
failing at the heart. I was actually permitting myself to experience a 
sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollect- 
ing my principles, I at once called my sensations to order; and it was 
wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder—how I cleared up the 
mistake of supposing Mr. Rochester’s movements a matter in which I 
had any cause to take a vital interest. Not that I humbled myself by a 
slavish notion of inferiority: on the contrary, I just said,— 

‘Vou have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than 
40 receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protégée, and to be 
grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty, 
you have a right to expect at his hands. Be sure that is the only tie he 
seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don’t make him the 
object of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth. He is 
not of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lav- 
ish the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is 
not wanted and would be despised.” 

I went on with my day’s business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague 
suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit 
Thornfield, and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and ponder- 
ing conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think it 
necessary to check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could. 

Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post 
brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter, 

“Tt is from the master,” said she, as she looked at the direction. “Now 
I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not.” 

And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on 
taking my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to 
that circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face. Why my 
hand shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup 
into my saucer, I did not choose to consider. 

“Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of 
being busy enough now—for a little while at least,” said Mrs. Fairfax, 
still holding the note before her spectacles. 

Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of 
Adéle’s pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to 
another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly,— 

“Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?” 

“Indeed he is—in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; 
and not alone either, I don’t know how many of the fine people at the 


JANE EYRE 139 


Leas are coming with him. He sends directions for all the best bed. 
rooms to be prepared, and the library and drawing-rooms are to be 
cleaned out; and I am to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn 
at Millcote, and from whcrever else I can; and the ladies will bring their 
maids and the gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of 
it.” And Mrs. Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to 
commence operations. 

The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough. I had thought 
all the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it 
appears I was mistaken. Three women were got to help; and such scrub- 
bing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets, such 
taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors and 
lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets: and 
feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since. Adéle 
ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company, and the 
prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies. She would 
have Sophie to look over all her “toilettes,” as she called frocks; to fur- 
bish up any that were “passées,” and to air and arrange the new. For 
herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump on 
and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters 
and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys. From 
school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her 
service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her 
and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French 
pastry, to truss game and garnish dessert-dishes. 

The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for 
dinner at six. During the intervening period I had no time to nurse 
chimeras, and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody, Adéle ex- 
cepted. Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my cheerful- 
ness, and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of doubts 
and portents, and dark conjectures. This was when I chanced to see the 
third-story staircase door (which of late had always been kept locked} 
open slowly and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim cap, 
white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the gal- 
lery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look into the 
bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms—just say a word, perhaps, to the char- 
woman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble mantel- 
piece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on. She would 
thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a mod- 
erate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with 
her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt. Only one 
hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all 
the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the 


140 JANE EYRE 


second story: there she sat and sewed—and nrobably laughed drearily to 
herself—as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon. 

The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me, - 
noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them; no one discussed her 
position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation. I once, 
indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the char- 
women, of which Grace formed the subject. Leah had been saying some- 
thing I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked,— 

“She gets good wages, I guess?” 

“Ves,” said Leah; “I wish I had as good: not that mine are to com- 
plain of—there’s no stinginess at Thornfield; but they’re not one-fifth 
of the sum Mrs. Poole receives. And she is laying by; she goes every 
quarter to the bank at Millcote. I should not wonder but she has saved 
enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave: but I suppose she’s 
got used to the place; and then she’s not forty yet, and strong and able 
for anything. It is too soon for her to give up business.” 

“She is a good hand, I dare say,” said the charwoman. 

“Ah! she understands what she has to do—nobody better,” rejoined 
Leah significantly; “and it is not every one could fill her shoes—not for 
all the money she gets.” 

“That it is not!” was the reply. “I wonder whether the master—~—” 

The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived 
me, and she instantly gave her companion a nudge. 

“Doesn’t she know?” T heard the woman whisper. 

Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped. 
All T had gathered from it amounted to this—that there was a mystery 
at Thornfield, and that from participation in that mystery I was pur- 
posely excluded. 

Thursday came, All work had been completed the previous evening; 
carpets were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counter- 
panes spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in 
vases: both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands 
could make them. The hall, too, was scoured, and the great carved 
clock, as well as the steps and banisters of the staircase, was polished to 
the brightness of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed re- 
splendent with plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics 
bloomed on all sides. 

Afternoon arrived. Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, 
her gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the com- 
pany—to conduct the ladies to their rooms, etc. Adéle, too, would be 
dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to 
the party that day at least, However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to 
apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks. For myself, I had no 


JANE EYRE 14 


need to make any change: I should not be called upon to quit my sanc~ 
tum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me—‘a 
very pleasant refuge in time of trouble.” 

It had been a mild, serene spring day—one of those days which, to- 
wards the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the 
varth as heralds of summer. It was drawing to an end now; but the eve- 
ning was even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolrocm with the win- 
dow open. 

“It gets late,” said Mrs, Fairfax, entering in rustling state. “I am 
glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned, 
for it is past six now. I have sent John down to the gates to see if there 
is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the 
direction of Millcote.” She went to the window. ‘Here he is!” said she, 
“Well John” (leaning out), “any news?” 

“They’re coming, ma’am,” was the answer. “They'll be here in ten 
minutes.” 

Adéle flew to the window. I followed, taking care to stand on one 
side, so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen. 

The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at Jast wheels 
were heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came 
two open carriages. Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the 
vehicles. Two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; 
the third was Mr. Rochester, on his black horse Mesrour, Pilot bounding 
before him: at his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the 
party. Her purple riding habit almost swept the ground, her veil 
streamed long on the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and 
gleaming through them, shone rich raven ringlets. 

“Miss Ingram!” exclaimed Mrs, Fairfax, and away she hurried to her 
post below. 

The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the 
angle of the house, and I lost sight of it. Adéle now petitioned to go 
down; but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she 
must not on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either 
now or at any other time, unless expressly sent for—that Mr. Rochester 
would be very angry, etc. “Some natural tears she shed,” on being told 
this; but as I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe 
them. 

A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen’s deep tones and 
ladies’ silvery accents blent harmoniously together; and distinguishable 
above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of 
Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof. 
Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through 


142 JANE EYRE 


the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors, and, 
for a time, a hush. 

“Eles changent de toilettes,” said Adéle, who, listening attentively, 
had followed every movement; and she sighed. 

“Chez maman,” said she, “quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais 
partout, au salon et A leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes 
de chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c’était si amusant: comme 
cela on apprend.” 

“Don't you feel hungry, Adéle?” 

“Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n’avons 
pas mangé.” 

“Well, now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down 
and get you something to eat.” 

And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs 
which conducted directly to the kitchen. All in that region was fire and 
commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and 
the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threaten- 
ing spontaneous combustion. In the servants’ hall two coachmen and 
three gentlemen’s gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I 
supnose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had 
been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere. Threading 
this chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold 
chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and 
fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat. I had regained the gal- 
lery, and was just shutting the back door behind me, when an ac- 
celerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their 
chambers. I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some 
of their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of 
victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was 
dark—quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering. 

Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: 
each came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through 
the dusk. For a moment they stood grouped together at the other ex~ 
tremity of the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity; 
they then descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist 
rolls down a hill. Their collective appearance had Ieft on me an im- 
pression of high-born elegance, such as I had never before received. 

I found Adéle peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held 
ajar. “What beautiful ladies!” cried she in English. “Oh, I wish I 
might go to them! Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by~and- 
by, after dinner?” 

“No, indeed, I don’t; Mr, Rochester has something else to think 


JANE EYRE 143 


about. Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to- 
Toorrow: here is your dinner.” 

She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her 
attention for a time. It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I, 
and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run 
a chance of getting no dinner at all—every one downstairs was too much 
engaged to think of us. The dessert was not carried out till after nine, 
and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee- 
cups. I allowed Adéle to sit up much later than usual; for she declared 
she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and 
shutting below, and people bustling about, Besides, she added, a mes- 
sage might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed, 
“et alors quel dommage!” 

I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a 
change I took her out into the gallery. The hall lamp was now lit, and 
it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing 
backwards and forwards. When the evening was far advanced, a sound 
of music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been re- 
moved. Adéle and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen. 
Presently a voice'blent with the rich tones of the instrument: it was a 
lady who sang, and very sweet her notes were. The solo over, a duet 
followed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the 
intervals. I listened long. Suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly 
intent on analyzing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate 
amidst the confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it 
caught them, which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the 
tones, rendered by distance inarticulate, into words. 

The clock struck eleven. I looked at Adéle, whose head leant against 
my shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms 
and carried her off to bed. It was near one before the gentlemen and 
ladies sought their chambers. 

The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the 
party to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood. They set out 
early in the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I wit- 
nessed both the departure and the return. Miss Ingram, as before, was 
the only lady equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her 
side: the two rode a little apart from the rest. I pointed out this cir- 
cumstance to Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me. 

“Vou said it was not likely they should think of being married,” said 
I; “but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other 
ladies.” 

“Ves, I dare say; no doubt he admires her.” 

“And she him,” I added: “look how she leans her head towards him, 


144 JANE EYRE 


as if she were conversing confidentially! I wish I could see her face; I 
have never had a glimpse of it yet.” 

“Vou will see her this evening,” answered Mrs, Fairfax. “I happened 
to remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adéle wished to be introduced 
to the ladies, and he said ‘Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after 
dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.’ ” 

“Ves; he said that from mere politeness. I need not go, I am sure,” 
T answered. 

“Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did 
not think you would Jike appearing before so gay a party—all strangers; 
and he replied, in his quick way, ‘Nonsense! If she objects, tell her it is 
my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in 
case of contumacy,’” 

“T will not give him that trouble,” I answered. “TI will go, if no better 
may be; but I don’t like it. Shall you be there, Mrs, Fairfax?” 

‘No, I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea, Vil tell you how to 
manage so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, 
which is the most disagreeable part of the business, You must go into 
the drawing-room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner- 
table; choose your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay 
long after the gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Roch- 
ester See you are there, and then slip away—nobody will notice you.” 

“Will these people remain long, do you think?” 

“Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more. After the Easter 
recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, 
will have to go up to town and take his seat; I dare say Mr. Rochester 
will accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so pro- 
tracted a stay at Thornfield.” 

It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when 
I was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room. Adéle had been in 
a state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the 
ladies in the evening, and it was not till Sophie commenced the opera- 
tion of dressing her that she sobered down. Then the importance of the 
process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged 
in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her long 
sash tied, and her Jace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any 
judge. No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was 
dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care previously 
to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and assured me she 
would not stir thence till I was ready. This I quickly was: my best dress 
(the silver-gray one, purchased for Miss Temple’s wedding, and never 
worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon smoothed; my sole orna- 
ment, the pearl brooch, soon assumed. We descended.

JANE EYRE 145 


Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than 
that through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner. We found 
the apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, 
and wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers 
with which the tables were adorned. The crimson curtain hung before 
the arch: slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the 
party in the adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing 
of their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur. 

Adéle, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemniz- 
ing impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out 
to her. I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near, 
endeavoured to read. Adéle brought her stool to my feet; ere long she 
touched my knee. 

“What is it, Adéle?” 

“Hist-ce que je ne puis pas prendre une seule de ces fleurs magni~- 
fiques, mademoiselle? Seulement pour completer ma toilette.” 

“You think too much of your ‘toilette,’ Adéle; but you may have a 
flower.” And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash. She 
sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were 
now full. I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not sup- 
press: there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little 
Parisienne’s earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress. 

A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept 
back from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit 
lustre pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent dessert- 
service covering a long ‘table; a band of ladies stood in the opening; 
they entered, and the curtain fell behind them. 

There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the 
impression of a much larger number. Some of them were very tall; 
many were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array 
that seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon, I 
rose and curtsied to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the 
others only stared at me. 

They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and 
buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds. Some of 
them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and otto- 
mans; some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books; 
the rest gathered in a group round the fire; all talked in a low but clear 
tone which seemed habitual to them. I knew their names afterwards, 
and may as well mention them now. 

First, there were Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters. She had evi- 
dently been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still, Of her 
daughters, the eldest, Amy, was rather little; naive, and childlike in face 


146 JANE EYRE 


and manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash 
became her well. The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in 
figure; with a very pretty face, of that order the French term minois 
chiffoné: both sisters were fair as lilies. 

Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very 
erect, very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful 
sheen: her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, 
and within the circlet of a band of gems. 

Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy, but, I thought, more ladylike. 
She had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair. Her black satin 
dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased me 
better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame. 

But the three most distinguished—partly, perhaps, because the tallest 
figures of the band—were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters, 
Blanche and Mary. They were all three of the loftiest stature of wom- 
en, The dowager might be between forty and fifty. Her shape was still 
fine; her hair (by candlelight at least) still black; her teeth, too, were 
still apparently perfect. Most people would have termed her a splendid 
woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but 
then there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her 
bearing and countenance. She had Roman features and a double chin, 
disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me 
not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed, with pride; and the 
chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost pre- 
ternatural erectness. She had, likewise, a fierce and hard eye-~it re- 
minded me of Mrs. Reed’s; she mouthed her words in speaking; her 
voice was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical—very in- 
tolerable, in short. A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some 
gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I presume she thought) with 
a truly imperial dignity. 

Blanche and Mary were of equal stature—straight and tall as pop- 
lars. Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a 
Dian. I regarded her, of course, with special interest. First, I wished to 
see whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax’s description;. 
secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted 
of her; and thirdly—it will out !—whether it were such as I should fancy 
likely to suit Mr. Rachester’s taste. 

As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my pic- 
ture and Mrs. Fairfax’s description. The noble bust, the sloping shoul- 
ders, the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets, were all there; 
—but her face? Her face was like her mother’s; a youthful unfurrowed 
likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride. It 
was not, however, so saturnine a pride. She laughed continually: her 


JANE EYRE 147 


laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and 
haughty lip. 

Genius is said to be self-conscious, I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram 
was a genius, but she was self-conscious—remarkably self-conscious in- 
deed. She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs. Dent. 
It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science; though, as she said, 
she liked flowers, “especially wild ones:” Miss Ingram had, and she ran 
over its vocabulary with an air. I presently perceived she was (what is 
vernacularly termed) trailing Mrs. Dent—that is, playing on her ignor- 
ance: her érail might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-natured. 
She played—her execution was brilliant; she sang—her voice was fine; 
she talked French apart to her mamma—and she talked it well, with 
fluency and with a good accent. 

Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer 
features, too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as 
a Spaniard). But Mary was deficient in life; her face lacked expression, 
her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat, 
remained fixed like a statue in its niche, The sisters were both attired in 
spotless white. 

And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester 
would be likely to make? I could not tell—I did not know his taste irr 
female beauty. If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of 
majesty: then she was accomplished, sprightly. Most gentlemen would 
admire her, I thought; and that he did admire her. I already seemed to 
have obtained proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but 
to see them together. 

You are not to suppose, reatler, that Adéle has all this time been sit- 
ting motionless on the stool at my feet. No. When the ladies entered, 
she rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said 
with gravity,— 

“Bon jour, mesdames,” 

And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and 
exclaimed, “Oh, what a little puppet!” 

Lady Lynn had remarked, “It is Mr. Rochester’s ward, I suppose 
the little French girl he was speaking of.” 

Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss. Amy and 
Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously  —~ 

“What a love of a child!” 

And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat ensconced 
between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English; ab- 
sorbing not only the young ladies’ attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton 
and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart’s content. 

At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned. I sit in 


148 JANE EYRE 


the shade—if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the 
window-curtain half hides me. Again the arch yawns; they come, The 
collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very 
imposing: they are al] costumed in black; most of them are tall, some 
young. Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and 
Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man. Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the 
district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and 
whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a 
pére noble de thédtre. Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall; like 
them, also, he is handsome: but he shares Mary’s apathetic and listless 
look; he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of blood or 
vigour of brain. 

And where is Mr. Rochester? 

He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter. 
I try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the 
meshes of the purse I am forming—I wish to think only of the work I 
have in my hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads‘ that lie 
in my lap: whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall 
the moment when I last saw it—just after I had rendered him, what he 
deemed, an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down 
on my face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager 
to overflow; in whose emotions I had a part. How near had I ap- 
proached him at that moment! What had occurred since calculated to 
change his and my relative positions? Yet now, how distant, how far 
estranged we were! So far estranged, that I did not expect him to come 
and speak to me. I did not wonder when, without looking at me, he took 
a seat at the other side of the room, and began conversing with some of 
the ladies. 

No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that 
I might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn invol- 
urtarily to his face: I could not keep their lids under control; they 
would rise, and the irids would fix on him. I looked, and had an acute 
pleasure in looking—a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with 
a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man 
might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet 
stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless. 

Most true is it that “beauty is in the eye of the gazer.” My master’s 
colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows, 
deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth—all energy, decision, will 
~—were not beautiful, according to rule: but they were more than beauti- 
ful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite mastered 
™me—that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them in his. 
Thad not intended to love him—the reader knows I had wrought hard to 


JANE EYRE 149 


extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected—and now, at 
the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously revived, green and 
strong! He made me love him without looking at me. 

I compared him with his guests. What was the gallant grace of the 
Lynns, the languid elegance of Lord Ingram, even the military distinc- 
tion of Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine 
power? I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I 
could imagine that most observers would call them attractive, hand- 
some, imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once 
harsh-featured and melancholy-looking. I saw them smile, laugh—it 
was nothing; the light of the candles had as much soul in it as their 
smile, the tinkle of the bell as much significance as their laugh. I saw 
Mr. Rochester smile: his stern features softened; his eye grew both 
brilliant and gentle, its ray both searching and sweet, He was talking, 
at the moment, to Louisa and Amy Eshton. I wondered to see them re- 
ceive with calm that look which seemed to me so penetrating: I ex~ 
pected their eyes to fall, their colour to rise under it. Yet I was glad 
when I found they were in no sense moved, “He is not to them what he 
is to me,” I thought; “‘he is not of their kind. I believe he is of mine— 
I am sure he is: I feel akin to him; I understand the language of his 
countenance and movements: though rank and wealth sever us widely, 
I have something in my brain and heart, in my blood and nerves, that 
assimilates me mentally to him. Did I say, a few days since, that I had 
nothing to do with him but to receive my salary at his hands? Did I 
forbid myself to think of him in any other light than as a paymaster? 
Blasphemy against nature! Every good, true, vigorous feeling I have 
gathers impulsively round him. I know J must conceal my sentiments; 
I must smother hope; I must remember that he cannot care much for 
me. For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not mean that I have 
his force to influence and his spell to attract; J mean only that I have 
certain tastes and feelings in common with him. I must, then, repeat 
continually that we are for ever sundered: and yet, while I breathe and 
think, I must love him.” 

Coffee is handed. The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have be-~ 
come lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry. Colonel Dent 
and Mr. Eshton argue on politics: their wives listen. The twa proud 
dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together. Sir 
George—whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe-—a very big 
and very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, 
coffee-cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word, Mr. Frederick Lynn 
has taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings 
of a splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently 
says little. The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded 


150 JANE EYRE 


arms on the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Ashton: she glances 
up at him, and chatters like a wren; she likes him better than she does 
Mr. Rochester. Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the 
feet of Louisa: Adéle shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with 
her, and Louisa laughs at his blunders. With whom will Blanche Ingram 
pair? She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an al- 
bum. She seems waiting to be sought; but she will nol wait too long: 
she herself selects a mate. 

Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as 
solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her sta- 
tion on the opposite side of the mantelpiece. 

“Mr, Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?” 

“Nor am 1.” 

“Then what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?” 
(pointing to Adéle). ‘Where did you pick her up?” 

“I did not pick her up; she was Jeft on my hands,” 

“Vou should have sent her to school,” 

“T could not afford it; schools are so dear.” 

“Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with 
her just now—is she gone? Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window- 
curtain, You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as expensive— 
more so, for you have them both to keep in addition.” 

I feared—or should I say, hoped?—the allusion to me would make 
Mr. Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther Alp 
the shade: but he never turned his eyes, 

“Y have not considered the subject,” said he indifferently, lacking 
straight before him. 

“No, you men never do consider economy and common sense. You 
should hear mamma on the chapter of governesses. Mary and I have 
had, I should think, a dozen at least in our day; half of them detest- 
able, and the rest ridiculous, and all inctbi—were they not, mamma?” 

“Did you speak, my own?” 

The young lady thus claimed as the dowager’s special property reiter- 
ated her cuestion with an explanation. 

“My dearcst, don’t mention governesses; the word makes me nervous. 
I have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice. I 
thank Heaven T have now done with them!” 

Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady, and whispered something 
in her ear: I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that 
one of the anathematized race was present. 

“Tant pis!” said her Jadyship, “I hope it may do her good!” Then, 
in a lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, “I noticed her; I 


JANE EYRE Ist 


am a judge of physiognomy, and in hers J see al] the faults of her class.” 

“What are they, madamr” inquired Mr. Rochester aloud. 

“T will tell you in your private ear,” replied she, wagging her turban 
three times with portentous significancy. 

“But my curiosity will be past its appetite, it craves food now.” 

“Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I.” 

“Oh, don’t refer him to me, mamma! I have just one word to say of 
the whole tribe—they are a nuisance. Not that I ever suffered much 
from them; I took care to turn the tables. What tricks Theodore and I 
used to play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jou- 
berts! Mary was always too sleepy to join ina plot with spirit. The best 
fun was with Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, 
lachrymose and low-spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in 
short; and Mrs, Grey was coarse and insensible—no blow took effect on 
her, But poor Madame Joubert! I see her yet in her raging passions, 
when we had driven her to extremities—spilt our tea, crumbled our 
bread and butter, tossed our books up to the ceiling, and played a 
charivari with the ruler and desk, the fender and fire-irons, Theodore, 
do you remember those merry days?” 

“Yaas, to be sure J do,” drawled Lord Ingram; ‘“‘and the poor old stick 
used to cry out, ‘Oh you villains childs!’—and then we sermonized her 
on the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we 
- were, when she was herself so ignorant.” 

“We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or 
persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining—the parson in the pip, 
as we used to call him. He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling 
in love with each other-—at least Tedo and I thought so. We surprised 
sundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of Ja 
belle passion, and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our 
discovery: we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights 
from the house. Dear mamma there, as soon as she got an inkling of 
the business, found out that it was an immoral tendency. Did you not, 
my lady-mother?” 

“Certainly, my best. And I was quite right: depend on that. There 
are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors 
should never be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly 

33 


“Oh, gracious, mamma! Spare us the enumeration! Az reste, we all 
know them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distrac- 
tions and consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached— 
mutual alliance and reliance; confidence thence resulting—insolence 
accompanying—mutiny and general blow-up. Am I right, Baroness 
Ingram, of Ingram Park?” 


182 JANE EYRE 


“My lily-flower, you are right now, as always.” 

“Then no more need be said: change the subject.” 

Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with 
her soft, infantine tone: “Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; 
but she was such a good creature, she would bear anything—nothing put 
her out. She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?” 

“No, never: we might do what we pleased—ransack her desk and her 
workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured, 
she would give us anything we asked for.” 

“T suppose, now,” said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, “we 
shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in 
order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new 
topic. Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?” 

“Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other.” 

“Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward. Signior Eduardo, 
are you in voice to-night?” 

“Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be.” 

“Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your 
lungs and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal 
service.” 

“Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?” 

“A fig for Rizzio!” cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as she 
moved to the piano. “It is my opinion the fiddler David must have been 
an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better. To my mind a - 
tian is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say 
what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion he was just the sort 
of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my 
hand.” 

“Gentlemen, you hear! Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?” 
ctied Mr. Rochester. 

“T should say the preference lies with you,” responded Colonel Dent. 

“On my honour, I am much obliged to you,” was the reply. 

Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the 
piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced 
a brilliant prelude—talking meantime. She appeared to be on her high 
horse to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not 
only the admiration but the amazement of her auditors: she was evi- 
dently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring 
indeed, 

“Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!” exclaimed 
she, rattling away at the instrument. “Poor, puny things, not fit to stir 
a step beyond papa’s park gates; nor to go even so far without mamma’s 
permission and guardianship! Creatures so absorbed in care about their 


JANE EYRE 153 


pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man 
had anything to do with beauty! As if loveliness were not the special 
prerogative of woman—her legitimate appanage and heritage! I grant 
an ugly woman is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the genztle- 
men, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour: let their 
motto be-—-Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a fillip. Such 
should be my device, were I a man.” 

“Whenever J marry,” she continued after a pause which none inter- 
rupted, “I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me, 
I will suffer no competitor near the throne; I will exact an undivided 
homage: his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he 
sees in his mirror. Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you.” 

“T am all obedience,” was the response. 

“Here then is a carsair-song. Know that I date on corsairs; and for 
that reason, sing it con spirito.” 

“Commands from Miss Ingram’s lips would put spirit into a mug of 
milk and water.” 

“Take care, then: if you don’t please me, I will shame you by show- 
ing how such things should be done.” 

“That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to 
fail.” 

“Gardez-vous en bien! If you err wilfully, I shall devise a propor- 
tionate punishment.” 

“Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to in- 
flict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance.” 

“Ha! explain!” commanded the lady. 

“Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense 
must inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient sub- 
stitute for capital punishment.” 

“Sing!” said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an 
accompaniment in spirited style. 

“Now is my time to slip away,” thought IT; but the tones that then 
severed the air arrested me. Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester pos- 
sessed a fine voice: he did—a mellow, powerful bass, into which he 
threw his own feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to 
the heart, and there waking sensation strangely. I waited till the last 
deep and full vibration had expired—till the tide of talk, checked an in- 
stant, had resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and 
made my exit by the side-door, which was fortunately near. Thence a 
narrow passage led into the hall. In crossing it, I perceived my sandal 
was loose; I stopped to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat 
at the foot of the staircase. I heard the dining-room door unclose; a 


154 JANE EYRE 


gentleman came out. Rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it 
was Mr. Rochester. 

“How do you do?” he asked. 

“T am very well, sir.” 

‘Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?” 

I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it; but 
I would not take that freedom. I answered,— 

“I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir.” 

“What have you been doing during my absence?” 

“Nothing particular; teaching Adéle as usual.” 

“And getting a good deal paler than you were—as I saw at first sight. 
What is the matter?” 

“Nothing at all, sir.” 

“Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?” 

“Not the least.” 

“Return to the drawing-room; you are deserting too early.” 

“T am tired, sir.” 

He looked at me for a minute. 

“And a little depressed,” he said. “What about? Tell me.” 

“Nothing—nothing, sir, I am not depressed.” 

“But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words 
would bring tears to your eyes—indeed, they are there now, shining and 
swimming, and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the 
flag. If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of 
a servant passing, I would know what all this means, Well, to-night I 
excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect 
you to appear in the drawing-room every evening: it is my wish; don’t 
neglect it. Now go, and send Sophie for Adéle. Good-night, my-——~’” 
He stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me. 


CHAPTER XVIII 


Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too. How 
different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and soli- 
tude I had passed beneath its roof! All sad feelings seemed now driven 
from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten; there was life every~ 
where, movement all day long. You could not now traverse the gallery, 
once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so tenantless, with~ 
out encountering a smart lady’s-maid or a dandy valet. 

The kitchen, the butler’s pantry, the servants’ hall; the entrance hall, 
were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when 
the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called 


JANE EYRE 155 


their occupants out into the grounds. Even when that weather was 
broken, and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast 
over enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and 
varied, in consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety. 

I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of 
entertainment was proposed: they spoke of “playing charades,” but in 
my ignorance I did not understand the term, The servants were called 
in, the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, 
the chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch. While Mr. Roch- 
ester and the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were 
running up and down stairs ringing for their maids. Mrs. Fairfax was 
summoned to give information respecting the resources of the house in 
shawls, dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the 
third story were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded 
and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, etc., 
were brought down in armfuls by the abigails. Then a selection war 
made, and stich things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir with- 
in the drawing-room, 

Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, 
and was selecting certain of their number to be of his party, “Miss 
Ingram is mine, of course,” said he; afterwards he named the two 
Misses Eshton, and Mrs. Dent. He looked at me: I happened to be 
near him, as I had been fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent’s bracelet, 
which had got loose. 

“Will you play?” he asked. I shook my head. He did not insist, which 

I rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to 
my usual seat, 
* He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain; the other party, 
which was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs. 
One of the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose 
that I should be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly nega- 
tived the notion, 

“No,” I heard her say; “she looks too stupid for any game of the 
sort,” 

Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up. Within the arch the 
bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise 
chosen, was scen enveloped in a white sheet, Before him, on a table, lay 
open a large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr, 
Rochester’s cloak, and holding a book in her hand. Somebody, unseen, 
rang the hell merrily; then Adéle (who had insisted on being one of her 
guardian’s party) bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of 
a basket of flowers she carried on her arm. Then appeared the magni- 
ficent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and 


156 JANE EYRE 


a wreath of roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, 
and together they drew near the table. They knelt; while Mrs. Dent 
and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white, took up their stations behind 
them. A ceremony followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to rec- 
ognize the pantomime of a marriage. At its termination, Colonel Dent 
and his party consulted in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel 
called out,—“Bride!” Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell. 

A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose. Its second rising 
displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last. The draw- 
ing-room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the 
dining-room; and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two 
back within the room, appeared a large marble basin, which I recognized 
as an ornament of the conservatory—where it usually stood, surrounded 
by exatics and tenanted by gold fish—and whence it must have been 
transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight. 

Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Roch- 
ester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head. His dark eyes and 
swarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked 
the very model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bow- 
string. Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram. She, too, was at- 
tired in oriental fashion—a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist; 
an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her beauti- 
fully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of supporting 
a pitcher poised gracefully on her head. Both her cast of form and 
feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea of some 
Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was doubtless the 
character she intended to represent. 

She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; 
she again lifted it to her head. The personage on the well-brink now 
seemed to accost her—to make some request. “She hasted, let down her 
pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink.” From the bosom of his 
robe he then produced a casket; opened it, and showed magnificent 
bracelets and earrings. She acted astonishment and admiration. Kneel- 
ing, he laid the treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were ex- 
pressed by her looks and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on 
her arms and the rings in her ears. It was Eliezer and Rebekah: the 
camels only were wanting. 

The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they 
could not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated. Colonel 
Dent, their spokesman, demanded “the tableau of the whole;” where- 
upon the curtain again descended. 

On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed, 
the rest being concealed by a screen hung with some sort of dark and 


JANE EYRE 157 


coarse drapery. The marble basin was removed; in its place stood a 
deal table and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim 
light proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extin- 
guished. 

Amidst this sordid scene sat a man, with his clenched hands resting on 
his knees and his eyes bent on the ground. I knew Mr. Rochester; 
though the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose 
from one arm, as if it had beén almost torn from his back in a scuffle), 
the desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair, might 
well have disguised him. As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists 
were attached fetters. 

“Bridewell!” exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved. 

A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their 
ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room. Mr. Rochester led 
in Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting. 

“Do you know,” said she, “that of the three characters, I liked you in 
the last best? Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant 
gentleman-highwayman you would have made!” 

“Ts all the soot washed from my face?” he asked, turning it towards 
her. 

“Alas! yes; the more’s the pity! Nothing could be more becoming 
to your complexion than that ruffian’s rouge.” 

“You would like a hero of the road, then?” 

“An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an 
Italian bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate.” 

“Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married 
an hour since, in the presence of all these witnesses.” She giggled, and 
her colour rose. 

“Now, Dent,” continued Mr, Rochester, “it is your turn.” And as the 
other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats, Miss 
Ingram placed herself at her leader’s right hand; the other diviners filled 
the chairs on each side of him and her. I did not now watch the actors; 
I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise: my attention 
was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the arch, 
were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs. What charade 
Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they 
acquitted themselves, I no longer remember. But I still see the con: 
sultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss 
Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards 
him, till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his 
cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged 
glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle re: 
turns in memory at this moment. 


158 JANE EYRE 


I have told you, reader, that I had learned to love Mr. Rochester, T 
could not unlove him now merely because I found that he had ceased to 
notice me—because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would 
never once turn his eyes in my direction—because I saw all his atten- 
tions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the 
hem of her robes as she passed, who, if ever her dark and imperious eye 
fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too 
mean to merit observation. I could not unlove him because I felt sure 
he would soon marry this very lady—because I read daily in her a proud 
security in his intentions respecting her—because I witnessed hourly in 
him a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be 
sought than to seek, was yet in its very carelessness captivating, and in 
its very pride irresistible. 

There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, 
though much to creat despair, Much, too, you will think, reader, to en- 
gender jealousy—if a woman in my position could presume to be jealous 
of a woman in Miss Ingram’s. But I was not jealous—or very rarely: 
the nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word. 
Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to ex- 
cite the feeling. Pardon the seeming paradox: I mean what I say. She 
was very showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many 
brilliant attainments: but her mind was poor, her heart barren by na- 
ture; nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural 
fruit delighted by its freshness. She was not good; she was not original: 
she used to repeat sounding phrases from books; she never offered, nor 
had, an opinion of her own. She advocated a high tone of sentiment; 
but she did not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness 
and truth were not in her. Too often she betrayed this by the undue 
vent she gave to a spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little 
Adéle—pushing her away with some contumelious epithet if she hap- 
pened to approach her; sometimes ordering her from the room, and al- 
ways treating her with coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine 
watched these manifestations of character—-watched them closely, keen- 
ly, shrewdly. Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, ex- 
ercised over his intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this 
sagacity—this guardedness of his—this perfect, clear consciousness of 
his fair one’s defects—this obvious absence of passion in his sentiments 
towards her, that my ever-torturing pain arose, 

I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political rea- 
sons, because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not 
given her his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win 
from him that treasure. This was the point—this was where the nerve 


JANE EYRE 159 


was touched and teased—this was where the fever was sustained and 
fed: she could not charm him. 

If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sin- 
cerely laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned 
to the wall, and (figuratively) have died to them. If Miss Ingrarn had 
been a good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, 
sense, J] should have had one vital struggle with two tigers—jealousy 
and despair: then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have ad- 
mired her—acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of 
my days: and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have 
been my admiration, the more truly tranquil my quiescence. But as 
matters really stood, to watch Miss Ingram’s efforts at fascinating Mr. 
Rochester, to witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that 
they did fail; vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and 
infatuatedly pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-com- 
placency repelled further and further what she wished to allure—to wit- 
ness this, was to be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless 
restraint. 

Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded, Ar- 
rows that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester’s breast and fell 
harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have 
quivered keen in his proud heart—have called love into his stern eye 
and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a 
silent conquest might have been won, 

“Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw 
so near to him?” J asked myself. “Surely she cannot truly like him, or 
not like him with true affection! If she did, she need not coin her 
smiles so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs 
so elaborate, graces so multitudinous. It seems to me that she might, 
by merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get 
nigher his heart. I have seen in his face a far different expression from 
that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him: but 
then it came of itself; it was not elicited by meretricious arts and cal- 
culated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it—to answer what he 
asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace 
—and it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one 
like a fostering sunbeam. How wiil she manage to please him when they 
are married? I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be 
managed, and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest 
woman the sun shines on.” 

I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester’s pro- 
ject of marrying for interest and connections. It surprised me when I 
first discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man 


£60 JANE EYRE 


unlikely to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a 
wife. But the longer I considered the position, education, etc., of the 
parties, the less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or 
Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled 
into them, doubtless, from their childhood. All their class held these 
principles: I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as 
I could not fathom. It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, 
I would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the 
very obviousness of the advantages te the husband’s own happiness of- 
fered by this plan convinced me that there must be arguments against 
its general adoption of which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure 
all the world would act as I wished to act. 

But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my 
master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a 
sharp lookout. It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of 
his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing 
of both, to form an equitable judgment. Now I saw no bad. The sarcasm 
that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only 
like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but 
their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid. And as for the 
vague something—was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a 
desponding expression?—that opened upon a careful observer, now and 
then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange 
depth partially disclosed: that something which used to make me fear 
and shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, 
and had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that some- 
thing, I, at intervals, beheld still, and with throbbing heart, but not with 
palsied nerves. Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare—to 
divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might 
look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets, and analyze their 
nature. 

Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride— 
saw only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their 
movements of importance—the rest of the party were occupied with 
their own separate interests and pleasures. The Ladies Lynn and Ingram 
continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their 
two turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting 
gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on 
which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets, Mild Mrs. Dent 
talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed 
a courteous word or smile on me. Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and 
Mr. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business. 
Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and 


JANE EYRE 16 


with one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly te 
the gallant speeches of the other. Sometimes all, as with one consent, 
suspended their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors; 
for, after all, Mr. Rochester and—because closely connected with him 
—-Miss Ingram were the life and soul of the party. If he was absent 
from the room an hour, a perceptible dullness seemed to steal over the 
spirits of his guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh im~ 
pulse to the vivacity of conversation. 

The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt 
one day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was 
not likely to return till late. The afternoon was wet: a walk the party 
had proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common 
beyond Hay, was consequently deferred. Some of the gentlemen were 
gone to the stables; the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, 
were playing billiards in the billiard-room. The Dowagers Ingram and 
Lynn sought solace in a quiet game at cards. Blanche Ingram, after 
having repelled, by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent 
and Mrs. Eshton to draw her into conversation, had first murmured 
over some sentimental tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having 
fetched a novel from the library, had flung herself in haughty listless- 
ness on a sofa, and prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the 
tedious hours of absence. The room and the house were silent; only 
now and then the merriment of the billiard-players was heard from 
above. 

It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of 
the hour to dress for dinner, when little Adéle, who knelt by me in the 
drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed,— 

“Voila Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!” 

I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa. The 
others, too, looked up from their several occupations; for at the same 
time a crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs be- 
came audible on the wet gravel. A post-chaise was approaching. 

“What can possess him to come home in that style?” said Miss 
Ingram. “He rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went 
out? and Pilot was with him. What has he done with the animals?” 

As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments 
so near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the 
breaking of my spine. In her eagerness she did not observe me at first; 
but when she did, she curled her lip, and moved to another casement. 
The post-chaise stopped, the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman 
alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr, Rochester: it was 
a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger. 

“How provoking!” exclaimed Miss Ingram. “You tiresome monkey!” 


162 JANE EYRE 


{apostrophising Adéle), “who perched you up in the window to give 
false intelligence?” and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in 
fault. 

Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the newcomer en. 
tered. He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present. 

“Tt appears I come at an inopportune time, madam,” said he, “when 
my friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long 
journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate ac- 
quaintance as to install myself here till he returns.” 

His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being 
somewhat unusual—not precisely foreign, but still not altogether Eng- 
lish; his age might be about Mr. Rochester’s—between thirty and forty; 
his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a fine-looking 
man, at first sight especially. On closer examination, you detected some- 
thing in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to please. His 
features were regular, but too relaxed; his eye was large and well-cut, 
but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life—at least so I 
thought. 

The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party. It was not till 
after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease. But 
T liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at 
the same time unsettled and inanimate. His eye wandered, and had no 
meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never 
remembered to have seen. For a handsome and not an unamiable-look- 
ing man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that smooth- 
skinned face of a full oval shape, no firmness in that aquiline nose and 
small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even forehead, no 
command in that blank, brown eye. 

As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the 
girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him—for he occupied 
an arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as 
if he were cold—I compared him with Mr. Rochester. I think (with 
deference be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between 
a sleek gander and a fierce falcon—between a meek sheep and the rough- 
coated keen-eyed dog; its guardian. 

He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend. A curious friend- 
ship theirs must have been—a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old 
adage that “extremes meet.” 

Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times 
scraps of their conversation across the room. At first I could not make 
much sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and 
Mary Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sen- 
tences that reached me at intervals. These last were discussing the 


JANE EYRE 163 


stranger. They both called him “a beautiful man.” Louisa said he was 
“a love of a creature,” and she “adored him;” and Mary instanced his 
“pretty little mouth, and nice nose,” as her ideal of the charming. 

“And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!” cried Louisa—‘so 
smooth—none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and 
such a placid eye and smile!” 

And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the 
other side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion 
to Hay Common. 

I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, 
and I presently gathered that the newcomer was called Mr. Mason. 
Then I learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he 
came from some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face 
was so sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in 
the house. Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, in- 
dicated the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little sur- 
prise I gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become ac- 
quainted with Mr. Rochester. He spoke of his friend’s dislike of the 
burning heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region. I knew 
Mr. Rochester had been a traveller—Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I 
thought the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now 
I had never heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores. 

I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat un- 
expected one, broke the thread of my musings Mr. Mason, shivering ag 
some one chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the 
fire, which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone 
hot and red. The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped 
near Mr. Eshton’s chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of 
which I heard only the words, “old woman’”—“quite troublesome.” 

“Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself 
off,” replied the magistrate. 

“No—stop!” interrupted Colonel Dent. “Don’t send her away, Esh- 
ton; we might turn the thing to account, Better consult the ladies.” 
And speaking aloud, he continued—“Ladies, you talked of going to Hay 
Common to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old 
Mother Bunches is in the servants’ hall at this moment, and insists upon 
being brought in before ‘the quality,’ to tell them their fortunes. Would 
you like to see her?” 

“Surely colonel,” cried Lady Ingram, “you would not encourage such 
a low impostor? Dismiss her, by all means, at once!” 

“But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady,” said the footman; 
“nor can any of the servants. Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, en- 
treating her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney- 


164 JANE EYRE 


corner, and says nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come 
in here.” 

“What does she want?” asked Mrs. Eshton. 

“To tell the gentry their fortunes,’ she says, ma’am; and she swears 
she must and will do it.” 

“What is she like?” inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath. 

“A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock.” 

“Why, she's a real sorceress!” cried Frederick Lynn. “Let us have her 
in, of course.’ 

“To be sure,” rejoined his brother; “it would be a thousand pities to 
throw away such a chance of fun.” 

“My dear boys, what are you thinking about?” exclaimed Lady Lynn. 

“I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding,” 
chimed in the Dowager Ingram. 

“Indeed, mamma, but you can—and will,” pronounced the haughty 
voice of Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool, where till now 
she had sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music. ‘I 
have a curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the bel- 
dame forward.” 

“My darling Blanche! recollect——” 

“T do—I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will— 
quick, Sam!” 

“Yes—yes—yes!” cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen, 
“Let her come; it will be excellent sport!” 

The footman still lingered. “She looks such a rough one,” said he. 

“Go!” ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went. 

Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery 
and jests was proceeding when Sam returned. 

“She won’t come now,” said he, ‘She says it’s not her mission to ap- 
pear before the ‘vulgay herd’ (them’s her words). I must show her into 
a room by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to 
her one by one.” 

“You see now, my queenly Blanche,” began Lady Ingram, “she en- 
croaches. Be advised, my angel girl—and 

“Show her into the library, of course,” cut in the “angel gizl.” “It is 
not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either; I mean to 
have her all to myself. Is there a fire in the library?” 

“Yes, ma’am—but she looks such a tinkler,” 

“Cease that chatter, blockhead, and do my bidding,” 

Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to ful! 
flow once more. 

“She’s ready now,” said the footman, as he reappeared. “She wishes 
to know who will be her first visitor,” 


JANE EVRE 165 


“T think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies 
go,” said Colonel Dent. 

“Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming.” 

Sam went and returned. 

“She says, sir, that she’ll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble 
themselves to come near her; nor,” he added, with difficulty suppressing 
a titter, “any ladies either, except the young and single.” 

“By Jove, she has taste!” exclaimed Henry Lynn. 

Miss Ingram rose solemnly. “I go first,” she said, in a tone which 
might have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope mounting a breach in 
the van of his men. 

“O my best! O my dearest! pause—reflect!’’ was her mamma’s cry; 
but she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which 
Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library. 

A comparative silence ensued. Lady Ingram thought it Je cas to wring 
her hands, which she did accordingly. Miss Mary declared she felt, for 
her part, she never dared venture. Amy and Louisa tittered under their 
breath, and looked a little frightened. 

The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the 
library-door again opened. Miss Ingram returned to us through the 
arch, 

Would she laugh? would she take it as a joke? All eyes met her with 
a glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and 
coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry; she walked stiffly to her 
seat, and took it in silence. 

“Well, Blanche?” said Lord Ingram. 

“What did she say, sister?” asked Mary. 

“What do you think? How do you feel? Is she a real fortune-teller?” 
demanded the Misses Eshton. 

“Now, now, good people,” returned Miss Ingram, “don’t press upon 
me, Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you 
seem, by the importance you all—my good mamma included—ascribe to 
this matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, 
whoa is in close alliance with the old gentleman. I have seen a gipsy 
vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palm- 
istry, and told me what such people usually tell. My whim is gratified; 
and now I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks 
to-morrow morning, as he threatened.” 

Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined 
further conversation. I watched her for nearly half an hour: during all 
that time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, 
more dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment. She 
had obviously not heard anything to her advantage; and it seemed to 


166 JANE EYRE 


me, from her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself, 
notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance 
to whatever revelations had been made her. 

Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they 
dared not go alone; and yet they all wished to go. A negotiation was 
opened through the medium of the ambassadar, Sam; and after much 
pacing to and fro, till, I think, the said Sam’s calves must have ached 
with the exercise, permission was at last with great difficulty extorted 
from the rigorous sibyl for the three to wait upon her in a body. 

Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram’s had been: we heard 
hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and at 
the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open and came 
running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits, 

“JT am sure she is something not right!” they cried, one and all. “She 
told us such things! She knows all about us!” and they sank breathless 
into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them. 

Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of 
things they had said and done when they were mere children; described 
books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home—keepsakes 
that different relations had presented to them. They affirmed that she 
had even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each 
the name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of 
‘what they most wished for. 

Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further 
enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes, 
ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity. The 
matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans, and again and 
again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had 
not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the young- 
er urged their services on the agitated fair ones, 

In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully en- 
gaged in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned 
and saw Sam. 

“If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young 
single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she 
will not go till she has seen all. I thought it must be you; there is no one 
else for it. What shall I tell her?” 

“Oh, I will go by all means,” I answered; and I was glad of the un- 
expected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity. I slipped 
out of the room, unobserved by any eye—for the company were gath- 
ered in one mass about the trembling trio just returned-~and I closed 
the door quietly behind me. 


JANE EVRE 167 


“Tf you like, miss,” said Sam, “I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she 
frightens you, just call and I’ come in.” 

“No, Sam, return to the kitchen; I am not in the least afraid.” Nor 
was I; but I was a good deal interested and excited. 


CHAPTER XIX 


Tur library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the sibyl—if 
sibyl she were—was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chim- 
ney-corner. She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet—or rather, a 
broad-brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under 
her chin. An extinguished candle stood on the table. She was bending 
over the fire, and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer- 
book, by the light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as 
most old women do, while she read. She did not desist immediately on 
my enttance: it appeared she wished to finish a paragraph. 

I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with 
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire. I felt now as composed 
as ever I did in my life; there was nothing indeed in the gipsy’s appear- 
ance to trouble one’s calm. She shut her book and slowly looked up; her 
hat brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she raised it, that 
it was a strange one. It looked all brown and black: elf-locks bristled 
out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin, and came 
half over her cheeks, or rather jaws. Her eye confronted me at once, 
with a bold and direct gaze. 

“Well, and you want your fortune told?” she said, in a voice as de- 
cided as her glance, as harsh as her features. 

“J don’t care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought 
toe warn you, I have no faith.” 

“Tt’s like your impudence to say so. I expected it of you; I heard it 
in your step as you crossed the threshold.” 

“Did you? You’ve a quick ear.” 

“I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain.” 

“You need them all in your trade,” 

“T do; especially when I’ve customers like you to deal with. Why 
don’t you tremble?” 

“Ym not cald.” 

“Why don’t you turn pale?” 

“T am not sick.” 

“Why don’t you consult my art?” 

“Ym not silly.” 

The old crone “nichered” a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she 


168 JANE EYRE 


then drew out a short, black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke. Hav- 
ing indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the 
pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very 
deliberately ,— 

“You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly.” 

“Prove it,” I rejoined. 

“J will, in few words. You are cold, because you are alone; no con- 
tact strikes the fire from you that is in you. You are sick, because the 
best of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far 
away from you. You are silly because, suffer as you may, you will not 
beckon it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it 
waits you.” 

She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smok- 
ing with vigour. 

“You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a 
solitary dependant in a great house.” 

“{ might say it to almost any one; but would it be true of almost any 
one?” 

“In my circumstances.” 

“Ves; just so, in your circumstances: but find me another precisely 
placed as you are.” 

“Tt would be easy ta find you thousands.” 

“You could scarcely find me one. If you knew it, you are peculiarly 
situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it. The materials are 
all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them. Chance 
Taid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached, and bliss 
results.” 

“T don’t understand enigmas. I never could guess a riddle in my life,” 

“Tf you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm.” 

“And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?” 

“To be sure.” 

I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she 
took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she told 
me to hold out my hand. I did. She approached her face to the palm, 
and pored over it without touching it. 

“Tt is too fine,” said she. “I can make nothing of such a hand as that 
almost without lines; besides, what is in a palm? Destiny is not writ- 
ten there.” 

"T believe you,” said I. 

“No,” she continued, “it is in the face—on the forehead, about the 
eyes, in the eyes themselves, in the lines of the mouth. Kneel, and lift 
up your head.” 


JANE EYRE 169 


“Ah! now you are coming to reality,” I said, as I obeyed her, “I shall 
begin to put some faith in you presently.” 

T knelt within half a yard of her. She stirred the fire, so that a ripple 
of light broke from the disturbed coal. The glare, however, as she sat, 
only threw her face into deeper shadow; mine, it illumined. 

“I wonder with what feelings you came to me tonight,” she said, when 
she had examined me a while. “I wonder what thoughts are busy in your 
heart during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people 
flitting before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympa- 
thetic communion passing between you and them as if they were really 
mere shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance.” 

“TI feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad.” 

“Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with 
whispers of the future?” 

“Not I. The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earn- 
ings to set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself.” 

“A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that win- 
dow-seat (you see I know your habits)——~” 

“You have learned them from the servants.” 

“Ah! you think yourself sharp. Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, 
I have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole-———” 

I started to my feet when I heard the name. 

“You have, have you?” thought I; “there is diablerie in the business 
after all, then!” 

“Don’t be alarmed,” continued the strange being; “she’s a safe hand is 
Mrs. Poole—close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her. 
But, as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of noth- 
ing but your future school? Have you no present interest in any of the 
company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you? Is there not one 
face you study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least 
curiosity?” 

“T like to observe all the faces and all the figures.” 

“But do you never single one from the rest—or it may be, two?” 

“T do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a 
tale: it amuses me to watch them.” 

“What tale do you like best to hear?” 

“Qh, I have not much choice* They generally run on the same theme 
—courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe—marriage.” 

“And do you like that monotonous theme?” 

“Positively, I don’t care about it; it is nothing to me.” 

“Nothing to you? When a lady, young and full of life and health, 
charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, 
sits and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you-——” 


170 JANE EYRE 


“{ what?” 

“You know—and perhaps think well of.” 

“T don’t know the gentlemen here. I have scarcely interchanged a 
syllable with one of them. And as to thinking well of them, I consider 
some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young, dash- 
ing, handsome, and lively; but certainly they are all at liberty to be the 
recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling disposed to 
consider the transaction of any moment to me.” 

“You don’t know the gentlemen here? You have not exchanged a 
syllable with one of them? Will you say that of the master of the 
house?” 

“He is not at home.” 

“A profound remark! A most ingenious quibble! He went to Millcote 
this morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that cir- 
cumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance—blot him, as 
it were, out of existence?” 

“No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochesler has to do with the 
theme you had introduced.” 

“T was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late 
so many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they over- 
flow like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?” 

“Mr, Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests.” 

“Wo question about his right; but have you never observed that, of all 
the tales told here about matrimony, Mr, Rochester has been favoured 
with the most lively and the most continuous?” 

“The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.” I said 
this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice, man- 
ner had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream. One unexpected 
sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web of 
mystification, and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for 
weeks by my heart watching its working and taking record of every 
pulse. 

“Ragerness of a listener!” repeated she, “Yes; Mr. Rochester has sat 
by the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight 
in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to re- 
ceive, and looked so grateful for the pastime given him: you have no- 
ticed this?” 

“Grateful! I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face.” 

‘Detecting! You have analyzed, then. And what did you detect, if 
not gratituder” 

I said nothing. 

“You have seen love—have you not?—and, looking forward, you have 
seen him married, and beheld his bride happy?” 


Te 


JANE EYRE 197i 


“Humph! Not exactly. Your witch’s skill is rather at fault some 
times.” 

“What the devil have you seen, then?” 

“Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess. Is it known that 
Mr. Rochester is to be married?” 

“Ves; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram.” 

“Shortly?” 

“Appearances would warrant that conclusion; and, no doubt (though, 
with an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question 
it), they will be a superlatively happy pair. He must love such a hand- 
some, noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him—or, 
if not his person, at least his purse. I know she considers the Rochester 
estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her 
something on that point about an hour ago which made her look won- 
drous grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch. I would advise 
her blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or 
clearer rent-roll, he’s dished——” 

“But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester’s fortune; I came 
to hear my own, and you have told me nothing of it.” 

“Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait 
contradicted another. Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: 
that I know. I knew it before I came here this evening. She has laid it 
carefully on one side for you. I saw her do it. It depends on yourself te 
stretch out your hand and take it up; but whether you will do so, is the 
problem I study, Kneel again on the rug.” 

“Don’t keep me Jong; the fire scorches me.” 

I knelt. She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back 
in her chair. She began muttering — 

“The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft 
and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible; impression 
follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases to smile, it 
is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid—that signifies melan- 
choly resulting from loneliness. It turns from me; it will not suffer fur- 
ther scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance, the truth of the 
discoveries I have already made—to disown the charge both of sensi- 
bility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in my opinion. 
The eye is favourable. 

“As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to im- 
part all that the brain conceives, though I dare say it would be silent on 
much the heart experiences. Mobile and flexible, it was never intended 
to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude; it is a mouth which 
should speak much and smile often, and have human affection for its in- 
terlocutor. That feature too is propitious. 


172 JANE EYRE 


“T see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow 
professes to say, ‘I can live alone, if self-respect and circumstances re- 
quire me so to do. I need not sell my soul to buy bliss. I have an inward 
treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights 
should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford to give,’ 
The forehead declares, ‘Reason sits firm and holds the reins, and she will 
not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild chasms. The pas- 
sions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they are; and the desires 
may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment shall still have the 
lasi word in every argument, and the casting vote in every decision. 
Strong wind, earthquake shock, and fire may pass by; but I shall follow 
the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the dictates of 
conscience.’ 

“Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected. I have 
formed my plans—right plans I deem them—and in them I have at- 
tended to the claims of conscience, the counsels of reason. I know how 
soon youth would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, 
but one dreg of shame or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do 
not want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution—such is not my taste. I wish to 
foster, not to blight; to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood—no, 
nor of brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet-—— 
That will do. I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium, I should 
wish now to protract this moment ad éfititwm; but I dare not. So far I 
have governed myself thoroughly. I have acted as I inwardly swore I 
would act; but further might try me beyond my strength. Rise, Miss 
Eyre: leave me; ‘the play is played out.’” 

Where was IP Did I wake or sleep? Had I been dreaming? Did I 
aream still? The old woman’s voice had changed: her accent, her ges- 
ture, and all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass—as the 
speech of my own tongue, I got up, but did not go. I looked; I stirred 
the fire, and I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage 
closer about her face, and again beckoned me to depart. The flame il- 
luminated her hand stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for dis- 
coveries, I at once noticed that hand. It was no more the withered limb 
of eld than my own; it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fin- 
gers, symmetrically turned. A broad ring flashed on the little finger, and 
stooping forward I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred 
times before. Again I looked at the face, which was no longer tured 
from me; on the contrary, the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, 
the head advanced. 

“Well, Jane, do you know me?” asked the familiar voice. 

“Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then af 

“But the string is in a knot—help me.” 


JANE EYRE 173 


“Break it, sir.” 

“There, then-—‘Off, ye lendings!’”” And Mr. Rochester stepped out of 
his disguise. 

“Now, sir, what a strange idea!” 

“But well carried out, eh? Don’t you think so?” 

“With the ladies you must have managed well.” 

“But not with you?” 

“You did not act the character of a gipsy with me.” 

“What character did I act? My own?” 

“No; some unaccountable one. In short, I believe you have been try- 
ing to draw me out—or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me 
talk nonsense. It is scarcely fair, sir.” ° 

“Do you forgive me, Jane?” 

“I cannot tell till I have thought it all over. If, on reflection, I find I 
have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you; but it was 
not right.” 

“Oh, you have been very correct—very careful, very sensible.” 

I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had. It was a comfort; but, 
indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the inter- 
view. Something of masquerade I suspected. I knew gipsies and for- 
tune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had 
expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to 
conceal her features. But my mind had been running on Grace Poole— 
that living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her. I had 
never thought of Mr. Rochester. 

“Well,” said he, “what are you musing about? What does that grave 
smile signify?” 

“Wonder and self-congratulation, sir. I have your permission to retire 
now, I suppose?” 

“No; stay a moment, and tell me what the people in the drawing-room 
yonder are doing.” 

“Discussing the gipsy, I daresay.” 

“Sit down!—Let me hear what they said about me.” 

“T had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o’clock. Oh, 
are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you 
left this morning?” 

“A stranger !—no; who can it be? I expected no one. Is he gone?” 

“No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the lib- 
erty of installing himself here till you returned.” 

“The devil he did! Did he give his name?” 

“Fis name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies—from 
Spanish Town, in Jamaica, I think.” 

Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to 


174 JANE EYRE 


lead me to a chair. As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the 
smile on his lips froze; apparently a spasm caught his breath. 

“Mason’~—the West Indies!” he said, in the tone one might fancy a 
speaking automaton to announce its single words. “Mason!—the West 
Indies!” he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times, grow- 
ing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly scemed to 
know what he was doing. 

“Do you feel ill, sir?” I inquired, 

“Jane, I’ve got a blow—I’ve got a blow, Jane!” He staggered. 

“Qh, lean on me, sir.” 

“Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now.” 

“Yes, sir, yes; and my arm.” 

He sat down, and made me sit beside him. Holding my hand in both 
his own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most 
troubled and dreary look. 

“My little friend!” said he, “I wish I were in a quiet island with only 
you, and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from 
me.” 

“Can I help you, sir?—I’d give my life to serve you.” 

“Jane, if aid is wanted, I’ll seek it at your hands; I promise you that.” 

“Thank you, sir. Tell me what to do,—I’ll try, at Jeast, to do it,” 

“Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room—they will 
be at supper there—and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is 
doing.” 

I went. I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr. 
Rochester had said. They were not seated at table,—the supper was ar- 
ranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood 
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands. 
Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general 
and animated. Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and 
Mrs. Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them. I filled a wine-glass 
(I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was 
taking a liberty, I dare say), and I returned to the library. 

Mr. Rochester’s extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once 
more firm and stern. He took the glass from my hand. 

“Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!” he said. He swallowed the 
contents and returned it to me. “What are they doing, Jane?” 

“Laughing and talking, sir.” 

“They don’t look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard some 
thing strange?” 

“Not at all; they are full of jests and gaiety.” 

“And Mason?” 

“He was laughing too,” 


JANE EYRE 175 


“Tf all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you 
do, Jane?” 

“Turn ther out of the room, sir, if I could.” 

He half smiled. “But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at 
me coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then 
dropped off and left me one by one, what then? Would you go with 
them?” 

“I rather think not, sir; I should have more pleasure in staying with 
you.” 

“To comfort mep” 

“Ves, sir, to comfort you as well as I could.” 

“And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?” 

“T, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I 
should care nothing about it.” 

“Then you could dare censure for my sake?” 

“T could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence 
as you, I am sure, do.” 

“Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper 
in his ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him; show him 
in here, and then leave me.” 

“Yes, sit.” 

I did his behest. The company all stared at me as I passed straight 
among them. I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded 
him from the room. I ushered him into the library, and then I went 
upstairs. 

At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors 
yepair to their chambers, I distinguished Mr. Rochester’s voice, and 
heard him say, “This way, Mason; this is your room.” 

He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease. I was soon 
asleep. 


CHAPTER XX 


I wap forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let 
down my window-blind. The consequence was, that when the moon, 
which was full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to 
that space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through 
the unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me. Awaking in the dead 
of night, I opened my eyes on her disk, silver-white and crystal clear. It 
was beautiful, but too solemn. I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw 
the curtain. 
Good God! what a cry! 


176 JANE EYRE 


The night—its silence, its rest-—was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp, 
a shrilling sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall. 

My pulse stopped; my heart stood still; my stretched arm was par- 
alyzid. The cry died, and was not renewed. Indeed, whatever being ut- 
tered that fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged 
condor on the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from 
the cloud shrouding his eyrie. The thing delivering such utterance must 
rest ere it could repeat the effort. 

It came out of the third story, for it passed overhead, And overhead, 
yes, in the room just above my chamber ceiling, I now heard a struggle 
—a deadly one it seemed from the noise—and a half-smothered voice 
shouted,— 

“Help! help! help!” three times rapidly. 

‘Will no one come?” it cried; and then, while the staggering and 
stamping went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:— 

“Rochester! Rochester! for God’s sake, come!” 

A chamber door opened; some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery. 
Another slLep stamped on the flooring above and something fell, and 
there was silence. 

I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued 
from my apartment, The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations, terri- 
fied murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one 
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled. Gentlemen and 
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and “Oh! what is it?’—-“Who is 
hurt?”—“What has happened?”—“Fetch a light !°—"Ts it fire?”—'‘Are 
there robbers?”—“Where shall we rum?” was demanded confusedly on 
all hands. But for the moonlight, they would have been in complete 
darkness. They ran to and fro, they crowded together; some sobbed, 
some stumbled; the confusion was inextricable. 

“Where the devil is Rochester?” cried Colonel Dent. ‘I cannot find 
him in his bed.” 

“Here! here!” was shouted in return. “Be composed, all of you; I’m 
coming.” 

And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester ad- 
vanced with a candle: he had just descended from the upper story. One 
of the ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram. 

“What awful event has taken place?” said she, “Speak! let us know 
the worst at once!” 

“But don’t pull me down or strangle me,” he replied; for the Misses 
Eshton were clinging about him now, and the two dowagers, in vast 
white wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail. 

“All’s right !—all’s right!” he cried. “It’s a mere rehearsal of Much 
Ado about Nothing. Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous.” 


JANE EYRE 177 


And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks. Calming him- 
self by an effort, he added,— 

“A servant has had the nightmare; that is all. She’s an excitable, ner- 
vous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something 
of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright. Now, then, I must 
see you all back into your rooms, for, till the house is settled, she cannot 
be looked after. Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the ladies the ex- 
ample. Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing superiority 
to idle terrors. Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a pair of 
doves, as you are. Mesdames” (to the dowagers), “you will take cold ta 
a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer.” 

And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to 
get them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories, I did not 
wait to be ordered Lack to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I 
had left it. 

Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed my- 
self carefully, The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words 
that had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me, for they had 
proceeded from the room above mine; but they assured me that it was 
not a servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house, 
and that the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an inven- 
tion framed to pacify his guests. I dressed, then, to be ready for emer- 
gencies, When dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over 
the silent grounds and silvered fields, and waiting for I knew not what. 
It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, . 
and call. 

No; stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, 
and in about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert. It 
seemed that sleep and night had resumed their empire. Meantime the 
moon declined; she was about to set. Not liking to sit in the cold and 
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was. I left 
the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet. As I stooped 
to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door. 

“Am I wanted?” I asked. 

“Are you up?” asked the voice I expected to hear—namely, my 
master’s. 

“Ves, sir.” 

“And dressed?” 

OV era ?? 

“Come out, then, quietly.” 

I obeyed. Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light, 

“T want you,” he said; I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat 
He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, lov: 


178 JANE EYRE 


corridor of the fateful third story. I had followed, and stood at his side, 

“Have you a sponge in your room?” he asked in a whisper. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Have you any salts—volatile salts?” 

“Ves?! . 

“Go back and fetch both.” 

I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my draw- 
er, and once more retraced my steps. He still waited; he held a key in his 
hand. Approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock; 
he paused, and addressed me again. 

“You don’t turn sick at the sight of blood?” 

“T think I shall not; I have never been tried yet.” 

I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness, 

“Just give me your hand,” he said: “it will not do to risk a fainting 
fit.” 

I put my fingers into his. “Warm and steady,” was his remark, He 
turned the key and opened the door. 

I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax 
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry 
was now looped up in one part, and there wags a door apparent, which had 
then been concealed. This door was open; a light shone out of the room 
within. I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog 
quarrelling, Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, “Wait 
a minute,” and he went forward to the inner apartment. A shout of 
laughter greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace 
Poole’s own goblin ha! ha! She then was there. He made some sort of 
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him. ' 
He came out and closed the door behind him. 

“Here, Jane!” he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large 
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of 
the chamber. An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in il, 
dressed with the exception of his coat. He was still; his head leant back; 
his eyes were closed. Mr, Rochester held’ the candle over him: I recog- 
nized in his pale and seemingly lifeless face—the stranger, Mason. I saw 
too that his linen on one side and one arm was almost soaked in blood, 

“Hold the candle,” said Mr. Rochester, and I took it. He fetched a 
basin of water from the washstand. “Hold that,” said he. I obeyed. He 
took the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he 
asked for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils. Mr, Mason 
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned. Mr. Rochester opened the shirt 
of the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he 
sponged away blood, trickling fast down. 

“Js there immediate danger?” murmured Mr. Mason. 


JANE EYRE 179 


“Pooh! Noa mere scratch. Don’t be so overcome, man; bear up! 
Y'll fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed 
by morning, I hope. Jane,” he continued. 

“Sire? 

“T shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman for an 
hour, or perhaps two hours, You will sponge the blood as I do when it 
returns. If he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to 
his lips, and your salts to his nose. You will not speak to him on any 
pretext—and—Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak to 
her: open your lips—agitate yourself—and I'll not answer for the 
consequences,” 

Again the poor man groaned. He looked as if he dared not move; fear, 
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyze him. 
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceed- 
ed to use it as he had done. He watched me a second, then saying, “Re- 
member!—no conversation,” he left the room. I experienced a strange 
feéling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating step 
ceased to be heard. 

Here then I was in the third story, fastened into one of its mystic 
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and 
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes— 
that was appalling—the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the 
thought of Grace Poole bursting out upon me. 

T must keep Lo my post, however. I must watch this ghastly counten- 
ance—these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose~these eyes now shut, 
now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and 
ever glazed with the dullness of horror. I must dip my hand again and 
again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore. 
I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; 
the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and 
grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely 
over the doors of a great cabinet opposite, whose front, divided into 
twelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, cach 
enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame, while above them at the top 
rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ. 

According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here 
or glanced there, it was now the bearded physician Luke that bent his 
brow; now St. John’s long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face 
of Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and 
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor—of Satan himself—in his 
Subordinate’s form, 

Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch—to listen for the 
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den. But since 


180 JANE EYRE 


Mr. Rochester’s visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but 
three sounds at three long intervals—a step creak, a momentary renewal 
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan. 

Then my own thoughts worried me. What crime was this, that lived 
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor 
subdued by the owner?—what mystery, that broke out now in fire and 
now in blood, at the deadest hours of night? What creature was it, that, 
masked in an ordinary woman’s face and shape, uttered the voice, now 
of a mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey? 

And this man I bent over—this commonplace, quiet stranger—how 
had he become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury 
flown at him? What made him seek this quarter of the house at an un- 
timely season, when he should have been asleep in bed? I had heard Mr. 
Rochester assign him an apartment below—what brought him here? 
And why, now, was he so tame under the violence or treachery done 
him? Why did he so quictly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester 
enforced? Why did Mr. Rochester enforce this concealment? His guest 
had been outraged, his own life on 2 former occasion had been hideously 
plotted against; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in 
oblivion! Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester; 
that the impetuous will of the latter held complete sway over the inert- 
ness of the former: the few words which had passed between them as- 
sured me of this. It was evident that in their former intercourse, the 
passive disposition of the one had been habitually influenced by the ac- 
tive energy of the other: whence then had arisen Mr. Rochester’s dismay 
when he heard of Mr. Mason’s arrival? Why had the mere name of this 
unresisting individual—whom his word now sufficed to control like a 
child—fallen on him, a few hours since, as a thunderbolt might fall on 
an oak? 

Oh! I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered, 
“Jane, I have got a blow—I have got a blow, Jane.” I could not forget 
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder; and it was 
no light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the 
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester. 

“When will he come? When will he come?” I cried inwardly, as the 
night lingered and lingered—as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, 
sickened, and neither day nor aid arrived. I had, again and again, held 
the water to Mason’s white lips; again and again offered him the stimu- 
lating salts: my efforts seemed ineffectual; either bodily or mental suf- 
fering, or loss of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his 
strength. He moaned s0, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he 
‘was dying; and I might not even speak to him. 

The candle, wasted at last, went out. As it expired, I perceived streaks 


JANE EYRE 181 


of gray light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching. 
Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the 
courtyard: hope revived. Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more 
the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved. It 
could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed 
shorter. 

Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch. 

“Now, Carter, be on the alert,” he said to this last. “I give you but 
half an hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the 
patient downstairs and all.” 

“But is he fit to move, sir?” 

“No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must 
be kept up. Come, set to work.” 

Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, 
let in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see 
how far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to 
brighten the east! Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was 
already handling. 

“Now, my good fellow, how are you?” he asked, 

“She’s done for me, I fear,” was the faint reply. 

“Not a whit!—courage! This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the 
worse of it: you’ve lost a little blood; that’s all. Carter, assure him 
there’s no danger.” 

“T can do that conscientiously,” said Carter, who had now undone the 
bandages; “nly I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have 
bled so much—but how is this? The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well 
as cut, The wound was not done with a knife; there have been teeth 
here!” 

“She bit me,” he murmured. “She worried me like a tigress, when 
Rochester got the knife from her,” 

“Vou should not have yielded; you should have grappled with her at 
once,” said Mr. Rochester. 

“But under such circumstances, what could one do?” returned Mason. 
“Oh, it was frightful!” he added, shuddering. “And I did not expect it; 
she looked so quiet at first.” 

“T warned you,” was his friend’s answer; “I said, ‘Be on your guard 
when you go near her.’ Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, 
and had me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to- 
night, and alone.” 

“T thought I could have done some good.” 

“You thought! you thought! Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you, 
But, however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not 


182 JANE EYRE 


taking my advice; so I'll say no more. Carter, hurry!—hurry! The sun 
will soon rise, and I must have him off.” 

“Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged. I must look to this other 
wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think.” 

“She sucked the blood: she said she’d drain my heart,’’ said Mason. 

I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of dis- 
gust, horror, hatred warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he 
only said,— 

“Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish; don’t repeat 
it.” 

“T wish I could forget it,” was the answer. 

“You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to 
Spanish Town, you may think of her as dead and buried—or rather, you 
» need not think of her at all.” 

“Impossible to forget this night!” 

“It is not impossible; have some energy, man. You thought you were 
as dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking 
now. There!—Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you de- 
cent in a trice. Jane” (be tumed to me for the first time since his re- 
entrance), “lake this key; go down into my bed-room, and walk straight 
forward into my dressing-room; open the top drawer of the wardrohe 
and take out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief; bring them here, and 
be nimble.” 

I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles 
named, and returned with them. 

“Now,” said he, “go to the other side of the bed while J order his 
toilet. But don’t leave the room; you may be wanted again,” 

I retired as directed. 

“Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?” inquired 
Mr. Rochester presently. 

“No, sir; all was very still.” 

“We shall get you off cannily, Dick; and it will be better, both for 
your sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder. I have striven 
Jong 10 avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last. Here. 
Carter, help him on with his waistcoat. Where did you leave your furred 
cloak? You can’t travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned 
cold climate, In your room?—Jane, run down to Mr. Mason’s room— 
the one next mine—and fetch a cloak you will see there.” 

Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and 
edged with fur. 

“Now, I’ve another errand for you,” said my untiring master; “you 
must away to my room again. What a mercy you are shod with velvet, 
Jane!—a clodhopping messenger would never do at this juncture, You 


JANE EYRE 183 


must open the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little 
phial and a little glass you will find there,—quick!” 

I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels. 

“That’s well! Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a 
dose myself, on my own responsibility. I got this cordial at Rome, of an 
Italian charlatan—a fellow you would have kicked, Carter. It is not a 
thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion—as now, 
for instance. Jane, a little water.” 

He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on 
the wash-stand. 

“That will do. Now wet the lip of the phial.” 

I did so. He measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented 
it to Mason. 

“Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour 
or so.” 

“But will it hurt me?—is it inflammatory?” 

“Drink! drink! drink!” 

Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist. He was 
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied. 
Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the li- 
quid; he then took his arm. 

“Now I am sure you can get on your feet,” he said—“try.” 

The patient rose. 

“Carter, take him under the other shoulder. Be of good cheer, Rich- 
ard; step out-—that’s it!” 

“T do feel better,” remarked Mr. Mason. 

“J am sure you do. Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the back- 
stairs; unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise 
you will see in the yard—or just outside, for I told him not to drive his 
rattling wheels over the pavement—to be ready; we are coming. And, 
Jane, if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem.” 

It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of ris- 
ing; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent. The side-passage door 
was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the yard 
was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a post-chaise, 
with horses ready harnessed and driver seated on the box, stationed out- 
side. I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming. He 

-nodded. Then I looked carefully round and listened. The stillness of 
early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over 
the servants’ chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the 
blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white gar- 
lands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses 
stamped from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still, 


1 84 JANE EYRE 


The gentlemen now appeared. Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester 
and the surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease. They assisted him 
into the chaise; Carter followed. 

“Take care of him,” said Mr. Rochester to the latter, “and keep hin 
at your house till he is quite well. I shall ride over in a day or two to see 
how he gets on. Richard, how is it with you?” 

“The fresh air revives me, Fairfax.” 

“Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind. Good- 
bye, Dick.” 

“Fairfax , 

“Well, what is it?” 

“Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be; let 
her. ”” he stopped and burst into tears. 

“T do my best; and have done it, and will do it,” was the answer. He 
shut up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away. 

“Yet would to God there was an end of all this!” added Mr. Roches- 
ter, as he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates. This done, he moved 
with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in the wall bordering 
the orchard. I, supposing he had done with me, prepared to return to 
the house; again, however, I heard him call ‘Jane!’ He had opened the 
porta] and stood at it, waiting for me. 

“Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments,” he said; 
“that house is a mere dungeon: don’t you feel it so?” 

“Tt seems to me a splendid mansion, sir.” 

“The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes,” he answered, “and 
you see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gild- 
ing is slime, and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marhie is sordid 
slate, and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark. Now 
here’ (he pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) “‘all is real, 
sweet, and pure,” 

He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, 
and cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other fuil of all sorts 
of old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies, min- 
gled with southernwood, sweet-brier, and various fragrant herbs. They 
were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by 
a lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the 
dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard 
trees and shone down the quiet walks under them. 

“Jane, will you have a flower?” 

He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it 
to me. 

“Thank you, sir.” 

“Do'you like this sunrise, Jane?—that sky with its high and light 


2 


JANE EYRE 185 


clouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm—this placid 
and balmy atmosphere?” 

“T do, very much.” 

“Vou have passed a strange night, Jane.” 

“Ves, sir.” 

“And it has made you look pale. Were you afraid when I left you 
alone with Mason?” 

“T was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room.” 

“But I had fastened the door—I had the key in my pocket. I should 
have been a careless shepherd if I had lett a lamb—my pet lamb—so 
near a wolf’s den, unguarded: you were safe.” 

“Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?” 

“Oh yes! Don’t trouble your head about her—put the thing out of 
your thoughts.” 

“Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays.” 

“Never fear; I will take care of myself,” 

“Ts the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?” 

“T cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England; nor even then. 
To live, for me, Jane, is to stand on 4 crater-crust which may crack and 
spue fire any day.” 

“But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led. Your influence, sir, is evi- 
dently potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully in- 
jure you.” 

“Oh no! Mason will not defy me, nor, knowing it, will he hurt me; 
but, unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, de- 
prive me, if not of life, yet for ever of happiness.” 

“Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show 
him how to avert the danger.” 

He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw 
it from him. 

“Tf I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be? Annihi- 
lated in a moment. Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had te 
say to him, ‘Do that,’ and the thing has been done. But I cannot give 
him orders in this case: I cannot say, ‘Beware of harming me, Richard;’ 
for it is imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is 
possible. Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further. You are 
my little friend, are you not?” 

“TJ like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right.” 

“Precisely; I see you do. I see genuine contentment in your gait and 
mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me— 
working for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, ‘all that 
ts right:’ for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no 
light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and ani- 


186 JANE EYRE 


mated complexion, My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale, 
and would say, ‘No, sir, that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it ig 
wrong;’ and would become immutable as a fixed star, Well, you too 
have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where 
{am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should trans. 
fix me at once.” 

“Tf you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from 
me, sir, you are very safe.” 

“God grant it may be so! Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down.” 

The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rug- 
tic seat. Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me; but J 
stood before him. 

“Sit,” he said; “the bench is long enough for two. You don’t hesitate 
to take a place at my side, do you? Is that wrong, Jane?” 

I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been 
unwise. 

“Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew-—while all the 
flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their 
young ones’ breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their 
first spell of work—I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to 
suppose your own. But first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and 
aot fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying.” 

“No, sir; I am content.” 

“Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy :—Suppose you were no long: 
er a girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from child- 
hood upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that 
you there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what 
motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and 
taint all your existence, Mind, I don’t say a crime ; I am not speak,‘ng of 
shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the pers 
petrator amenable to the law: word is error. The results of what you 
bave done become in time to utterly insupportable; you take meas- 
ures to obtain relief—unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor culpa- 
ble. Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very con- 
fines of life—your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel will 
not leave it Lill the time of setting. Bitter and base associations have - 
become the sole food of your memory; you wander here and there, seek- 
ing rest in exile, happiness in pleasure—I mean in heartless, sensual 
pleasure, such as dulls intellect and blights feeling. Heart-weary and 
soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary banishment: you 
make a new acquaintance-——how or where no matter: you find in this 
stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have sought 
for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all fresh 


JANE EYRE 187 


healthy, without soil and without taint. Such society revives, regener- 
ates: you feel better days come back—higher wishes, purer feelings; you 
desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains to you of 
days in a way more worthy of an immortal being. To attain this end, are 
you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom—a mere conventional 
impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your judgment 
approves?” 

He paused for an answer: and what was I to say? Oh for some good 
spirit to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response! Vain aspiration! 
The west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel bor- 
rowed its breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; 
but their song, however sweet, was inarticulate. 

Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:— 

“Ts the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man 
justified in daring the world’s opinion, in order to attach to him for ever 
this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own peace of 
mind and regeneration of life?” 

“Sir,” I answered, ‘‘a wanderer’s repose or a sinner’s reformation 
should never depend on a fellow-creature. Men and women die; phil- 
osophers falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you 
know has suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for 
strength to amend and solace to heal.” 

“But the instrument—the instrument! God, who does the work, or- 
dains the instrument. I have myself—I tell it you without parable— 
been a worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the 
instrument for my cure in——” 

He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling. 
I almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch 
the suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many min- 
utes, so long was the silence protracted, At last I looked up at the tardy 
speaker: he was looking eagerly at me. 

“Little friend,” said he, in quite a changed tone—while his face 
changed too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and 
sarcastic— you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: 
don’t you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a 
vengeance?” 

He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when 
he came back he was humming a tune. 

“Jane, Jane,” said he, stopping before me, “‘you are quite paler with 
your vigils; don’t you curse me for disturbing your rest?” 

“Curse your No, sir.” 

“Shake hands in confirmation of the word. What cold fingers! They 


188 JANE EYRE 


were warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysteri: 
ous chamber. Jane, when will you watch with me again?” 

“Whenever I can be useful, sir.” 

“For instance, the night before I am married! Iam sure I shall not he 
able to sleep. Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company? 
To you I can talk of my lovely one, for now you have seen her and know 
her.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“She’s a rare one, is she not, Jane?” 

“Ves, sir.” 

“A strapper—a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair 
just such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.—Bless me! there's 
Dent and Lynn in the stables! Go in by the shrubbery, through that 
wicket.” 

As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, say- 
ing cheerfully, — 

“Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sun- 
rise: I rose at four to see him off.” 


CHAPTER XXI 


PRESENTIMENTS are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are 
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has 
not yet found the key. I never laughed at presentiments in my life, be- 
cause I have had strange ones of my own, Sympathies, I believe, exist 
(for instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged rela- 
tives; asserting, notwithstanding theit alienation, the unity of the source 
to which each traces his origin), whose workings baffle mortal compre- 
hension. And signs, for ought we knaw, may be but the sympathies af 
Nature with man. 

When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie 
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little 
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, cither 
to one’s self or one’s kin. The saying might have worn out of my mem- 
ory, had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly 
to fix it there: the next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of 
her little sister, 

Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during 
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch thal had not 
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my 
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with 
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water, It was a 


JANE EVRE 189 


wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next; now it nestled 
close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition 
evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive nights 
to meet me the moment J entered the land of slumber. 

T did not like this iteration of one idea—this strange recurrence of one 
image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the 
vision drew near, It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I 
had been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it 
was on the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs 
by a message that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax’s room. On re- 
pairing thither, I found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of 
a gentleman’s servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he 
heid in his hand was surrounded with a crape band. 

“T dare say you hardly remember me, miss,” he said, rising as I en- 
tered; “but my name is Leaven. I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when 
you were at Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still.” 

“Oh, Robert! how do you do? I remember you very well: you used to 
give me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana’s bay pony. And how is 
Bessie? You are married to Bessie?” 

“Yes, miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me an- 
other little one about two months since—we have three now—and both 
mother and child are thriving.” 

“And are the family well at the house, Robert?” 

“T am sorry I can’t give you better news of them, miss: they are very 
badly at present-—in great trouble.” 

“T hope no one is dead,” I said, glancing at his black dress. He too 
looked down at the crape round his hat, and replied,-— 

“Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London.” 

“Mr. John?” 

Ves,” 

“And how does his mother bear it?” 

“Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap. His life has 
been very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange 
ways, and his death was shocking.” 

“T heard from Bessie he was not doing very well.” 

‘Doing well! He could not do worse; he ruined his health and his es- 

tate amongst the worst men and the worst women. He got into debt and 
into jail. His mother helped him out twice; but as soon as he was free 
he returned to his old companions and habits. His head was not strong: 
the knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard. 
He came down to Gateshead about three weeks ago, and wanted missis 
to give up all to him. Missis refused: her means have long been much 
reduced by his extravagance. So he went back again, and the next news 


190 JANE EYRE 


was that he was dead. How he died, God knows!—they say he killed 
himself.” 

I was silent: the tidings were frightful. Robert Leaven resumed,— 

“Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very 
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of pov- 
erty were quite breaking her down. The information about Mr. John’s 
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke. 
She was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rath- 
er better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept 
making signs to my wife and mumbling. It was only yesterday morning, 
however, that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and 
at last she made out the words, ‘Bring Jane—fetch Jane Eyre: I want to 
speak to her.’ Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or 
means anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Geor- 
giana, and advised them to send for you. The young ladies put it off at 
first; but their mother grew so restless, and said, ‘Jane, Jane,’ so many 
times, that at last they consented, I left Gateshead yesterday; and if 
you can get ready, miss, I should like to take you back with me early to- 
morrow morning.” 

“Ves, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go.” 

“T think so too, miss. Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse. 
But I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?” 

“Yes, and I will do it now;” and having directed him to the servants’ 
hall, and recommended him to the care of John’s wife, and the attentions 
of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester. 

He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the sta- 
bles, or the grounds. I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him:—yes; 
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram. To the billiard- 
room l hastened. The click of balls and the hum of voices resounded 
thence: Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their 
admirers, were all busied in the game. It required some courage to dis- 
turb so interesting a party. My errand, however, was one I could not 
defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram’s side. 
She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed 
to demand, “What can the creeping creature want now?” and when I 
said, in a low voice, “Mr. Rochester,” she made a movement as if tempt- 
ed to order me away. I remember her appearance at the moment; it 
was very graceful and very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky- 
blue crape; a gauzy azure scarf was twisted in her hair. She had been all 
animation with the game, and irritated pride did not lower the expres- 
sion of her haughty lineaments. 

“Does that person want youP” she inquired of My, Rochester; and 
Mr. Rochester turned to see who the “person” was. He made a curious 


JANE EYRE gr 


grimace—one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations—threw down 
his cue, and followed me from the room. 

“Well, Jane?” he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom 
door, which he had shut. 

“Tf you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.” 

“What to do?—where to go?” 

“To see a sick lady who has sent for me.” 

“What sick lady?—where does she live?” 

“At Gateshead, in ——shire.” 

“shire? That is a hundred miles off! Who may she be that sends 
for people to see her that distance?” 

“Her name is Reed, sir—Mrs. Reed.” 

“Reed of Gateshead? There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.” 

“Tt is his widow, sir.’ 

“And what have you to do with her? How do you know her?” 

“Mr. Reed was my uncle—my mother’s brother.” 

“The deuce he was! You never told me that before; you always said 
you had no relations.” 

“None that would own me, sir. Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast 
me off.” 

“Why?” 

“Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.” 

“But Reed left children?—you must have cousins? Sir George Lynn 
was talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of 
the veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana 
Reed of the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season 
or two ago in London.” 

“John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his 
family, and is supposed to have committed suicide. The news so shocked 
his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack.” 

“And what good can you do her? Nonsense, Jane! I would never 
think of running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be 
dead before you reach her. Besides, you say she cast you off.” 

“Yes, sir; but that is long ago, and when her circumstances were very 
different. I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now.” 

“Flow long will you stay?” 

“As short a time as possible, sir.” 

“Promise me only to stay a week: 

“T had better not pass my word; I might be obliged to break it.” 

“At all events you will come back—you will not be induced under any 
pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?” 

“Oh no! I shall certainly return if all be well.” 

“And who goes with you? You don’t travel a hundred miles alone.” 


192 JANE EVRE 


“No, sir; she has sent her coachman.” 

“A person to be trusted?” 

“Ves, sir; he has lived ten years in the family.” 

Mr. Rochester meditated. ‘When do you wish to go?” 

“Early to-morrow morning, sir.” 

“Well, you must have some money; you can’t travel without money, 
and I dare say you have not much: I have given you no salary yet. How 
much have you in the world, Jane?” he asked, smiling, 

I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was. “Five shillings, sir.” He 
took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as 
if its scantiness amused him. Soon he produced his pocket-book. 
“Here,” said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me 
but fifteen. I told him I had no change. 

“T don’t want change; you know that. Take your wages.” 

I declined accepting more than was my due, He scowled at first; then, 
as if recollecting something, he said,— 

“Right, right! Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay 
away three months if you had fifty pounds, There are ten; is it not 
plenty?” 

“Yes, sir; but now you owe me five.” 

“Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds.” 

“Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to 
you while I have the opportunity.” 

“Matter of business? I am curious to hear it.” 

“You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to 
be married?” 

“Ves; what then?” 

“Tn that case, sir, Adéle ought to go to school: I am sure you will per- 
ceive the necessity of it.” 

“To get her out of my bride’s way, who might otherwise walk over her 
rather too emphatically? There’s sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of 
it. Adéle, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march 
straight to—the devil?” 

“I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere.” 

“In course!” he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of 
features equally fantastic and ludicrous. He looked at me some minutes. 

“And old Madam Reed, or the misses, her daughters, will be solicited 
by you to seek a place, I suppose?” 

“No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify 
me in asking favours of them: but I shall advertise.” 

“You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!” he growled. “At your 
peril you advertise! I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of 
ten pounds. Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I’ve a use for it.” 


JANE EYRE 593 


“And so have I, sir,” I returned, putting my hands and my purse be- 
hind me. “I could not spare the money on any account.” 

“Little niggard!” said he, “refusing me a pecuniary request! Give me 
five pounds, Jane.” 

“Not five shillings, sir—nor five pence.” 

“Just let me look at the cash.” 

“No, sir; you are not to be trusted.” 

“Jane!” 

“Sir?” 

“Promise me one thing.” 

“Y’ll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform.” 

“Not to advertise; and to trust this quest of a situation to me. Ill 
find you one in time.” 

“I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I 
and Adéle shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters 
it.” 

“Very well! very well! Dll pledge my word on it. You go to-morrow, 
then?” 

“Ves, sir; early.” 

“Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?” 

“No, sir; I must prepare for the journey.” 

“Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?” 

“T suppose so, sir,” 

“And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane? Teach 
me; I’m not quite up to it.” 

“They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.” 

“Then say it.” 

“Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.” 

“What must I saye” 

“The same, if you like, sir.” 

“Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?” 

“Ves,” 

“Tt seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly, I should like 
something else—a little addition to the rite. If one shook hands, for in- 
stance; but no—that would not content me either. So you'll do no more 
than say Farewell, Jane?” 

“Tt is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty 
word as in many.” 

“Very likely; but it is blank and cool—Farewell.’ ” 

“Flow long is he going to stand with his back against that door?” T 
asked myself; “I want to commence my packing.” 

The dinner-bell rang, and suddenly away he bolted, without another 


194 JANE EYRE 


syllable. I saw him no more during the day, and was off before he had 
risen in the morning. 

I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o’clock in the afternoon of 
the first of May. I stepped in there before going up to the hall. It was 
very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white 
curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished 
bright, and the fire burnt clear. Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her 
last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner. 

“Bless you!~-I knew you would come!” exclaimed Mrs. Leaven as I 
entered. 

“Yes, Bessie,” said I, after I had kissed her; “and I trust I am nol too 
late. How is Mrs. Reed?—Alive still, I hope.” 

“Ves, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was. The 
doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she 
will finally recover.” 

“Fas she mentioned me lately?” 

“She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would 
come; but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at 
the house, She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and 
wakes up about six or seven. Will you rest yourself here an hour, miss, 
and then I will go up with you?” 

Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle 
and went to welcome him. Afterwards she insisted on my taking off my 
bonnet and having some tea, for she said I looked pale and tired. I was 
glad to accept her hospitality, and I submitted to be relieved of my 
travelling garb just as passively as I used to Jet her undress me when a 
child. 

Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about— 
setting out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting brend and butter, 
toasting a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an 
occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days. Bes- 
sie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good 
looks, 

Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to 
sit still, quite in her old peremptory tones. I must be served al the fire- 
side, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my cup 
and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with 
some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and 
obeyed her as in bygone days. 

She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort 
of 4 person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a mas- 
ter, whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him. I told her he 
was rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me 


4 Bg 2 
JANE EYRE f* 195 


kindly, and I was content. Then I went on to describe to her the gay 
company that had Jately been staying at the house; and to these details 
Bessie listened with interest—they were precisely of the kind she 
relished. 

In such conversation an hour was soon gone. Bessie restored to me 
my bonnet, etc., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the 
hall. It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, 
walked down the path I was now ascending, On a dark, misty, raw 
morning in January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and em- 
bittered heart—a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation—to seek 
the chilly harbourage of Lowood, that bourne so far away and unex- 
plored. The same hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects 
were doubtful yet; and I had yet an aching heart. I still felt as a wan- 
derer on the face of the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself 
and my own powers, and less withering dread of oppression. The gaping 
wound of my wrongs, too, was now quite healed, and the flame of re- 
sentment extinguished. 

“Vou shall go into the breakfast-room first,” said Bessie, as she pre- 
ceded me through the hall; “the young ladies will be there.” 

In another moment I was within that apartment. There was every ar- 
ticle of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first intro- 
duced to Mr. Brocklehurst; the very rug he stood upon still covered the 
hearth. Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two 
volumes of Bewick’s British Birds occupying their old place on the third 
shelf, and Gulliver’s Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above. 
The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had al- 
tered past recognition. 

Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as 
Miss Ingram—very thin Loo, with a sallow face and severe mien. There 
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme 
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen collar, 
hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a 
string of ebony heads and a crucifix. This I felt sure was Eliza, though 
T could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and 
colourless visage. 

The other was as certainly Georgiana; but not the Georgiana I re- 
membered—the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven. This was a full-blown, 
very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular feat- 
ures, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair. The hue of her 
dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her sister’s— 
so much more flowing and becoming—it looked as stylish as the other’s 
looked puritanical. 

In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother—and only 


196 JANE EYRE 


one: the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent’s Cairngorm eye; 
the blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and 
chin—perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable hard- 
ness to the countenance, otherwise so voluptuous and buxom, 

Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed 
me by the name of “Miss Eyre.” Eliza’s greeting was delivered in a 
short, abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed 
her eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me. Georgiana added to her, 
“How d’ye do?” several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, 
and so on, uttered in rather a drawling tone, and accompanied by sun- 
dry side-glances that measured me from head to foot—now traversing 
the folds of my drab merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain 
trimming of my cottage bonnet. Young ladies have a remarkable way of 
letting you know that they think you a “quiz” without actually saying 
the words, A certain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, non- 
chalance of tone, express fully their sentiments on the point, without 
committing them by any positive rudeness in word or deed. 

A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that 
power over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was 
surprised to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and 
the semi-sarcastic attentions of the other-—Eliza did not mortify, nor 
Georgiana ruffle me. The fact was, I had other things to think about; 
within the last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more 
potent than any they could raise—pains and pleasures so much more 
acute and exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to 
inflict or bestow—that their airs gave me no concern either for good or 
bad. 

“How is Mrs, Reed?” I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who 
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected 
liberty. 

“Mrs. Reed? Ah! mamma, you mean. She is extremely poorly: I 
doubt if you can see her to-night.” 

“Tf,” said I, “you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I 
should be much obliged to you.” 

Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide. 
“T know she had a particular wish to see me,” I added, “and I would 
not defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary.” 

“Mamma dislikes being disturbed in an evening,” remarked Eliza. I 
soon rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I 
would just step out to Bessie—who was, I dared say, in the kitchen— 
and ask her to ascertain whether Mrs, Reed was disposed io receive me 
or not to-night. I went, and having found Bessie and dispatched her on 
my errand, I proceeded to take further measures, It had heretofore been 


JANE EVRE 197 


my habit always to shrink from arrogance; received as I had been to- 
day, I should, a year ago, have resolved to quite Gateshead the very 
next morning: now, it was disclosed to me all at once that that would 
be a foolish plan. I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to sce my 
aunt, and I must stay with her till she was better—or dead: as to her 
daughters’ pride or folly, I must put it on one side, make myself inde-~ 
pendent of it. So I addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a 
room, told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had 
my trunk conveyed to my chamber, and followed it thither mysclf. I 
met Bessie on the landing. 

“Missis is awake,” said she; “I have told her you are here: come and 
let us see if she will know you.” 

I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had 
so often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days. 
ft hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood 
on the table, for it was now getting dark. There was the great four-post 
bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the arm-chair, 
and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to 
kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted. I looked into a 
certain corner near, half expecting to see the slim outline of a once 
dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap cut imp-like 
and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck. I approached the bed; I 
opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows. 

Well did I remember Mrs. Reed’s face, and I eagerly sought the fam- 
iliar image. It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of ven- 
geance and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion. I had left this 
woman in bitterness and hate, and I came back to‘her now with no other 
emotion than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearn- 
ing to forget and forgive all injuries—to be reconciled and clasp hands 
in amity. 

The well-known face was there, stern, relentless as ever—there was 
that peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised, 
imperious, despotic eyebrow. How often had it lowered on me menace 
and hate! and how the recollection of childhood’s terrors and sorrows 
revived as I traced its harsh line naw! And yet I stooped down and 
kissed her: she looked at me. 

“Ts this Jane Eyre?” she said. 

“Ves, Aunt Reed, How are you, dear aunt?” 

I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it 
no sin to forgel and break thal vow now. My fingers had fastened on 
her hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I 
should at that moment have experienced true pleasure. But unimpres- 
sionable natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so 


198 JANE EYRE 


readily eradicated. Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face 
rather from me, she remarked that the night was warm. Again she re- 
garded me so icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me—~her feeling to- 
wards me—was unchanged and unchangeable. I knew by her stony eye 
—opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to tears—that she was resolved Lo 
consider me bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her 
no generous pleasure, only a sense of mortification. 

I felt pain, and then IJ felt ire; and then I felt a determination to sub- 
due her—to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will. 
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their 
source. I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over 
the pillow. 

“You sent for me,” 1 said, “and I am here; and it is my intention to 
stay till I see how you get on,” 

“Oh, of course! You have seen my daughters?” 

Wes.” 

“Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things 
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a 
difficulty in recalling them, But there was something I wished to say— 
let me see——” 

The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken 
place in her once vigorous frame, Turning restlessly, she drew the bed- 
clothes round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it 
down: she was at once irritated. 

“Sit up!” said she; “don’t annoy me with holding the clothes fast. 
Are you Jane Eyre?” 

“T am Jane Eyre.” 

“T have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe. 
Such a burden to be left on my hands—and so much annoyance as she 
caused me, daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and 
her sudden starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural waichings of 
one’s movements! I declare she talked to me once like something mad, 
or like a fiend—no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to 
get her away from the house. What did they do with her at Lowood? 
The fever broke out there, and many of the pupils died. She, however, 
did not die; but I said she did—I wish she had died!” 

“A strange wish, Mrs, Reed; why do you hate her so?” 

“I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband’s only 
sister, and a great favourite with him. He opposed the family’s dis- 
owning her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of 
her death, he wept like a simpleton. He would send for the baby; 
though I entreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its 
maintenance. I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it—a sickly, 


JANE EYRE 199 


whining, pining thing! It would wail in its cradle all night long—not 
screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning. 
Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his 
own-——more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own at that age. He would 
try to make my children friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could 
not bear it, and he was angry with them when they showed their dis- 
like. In his last illness he had it brought continually to his bedside; and 
but an hour before he died, he bound me by a vow to keep the creature. 
I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out of a work- 
house: but he was weak, naturally weak. John does not at all resemble 
his father, and I am glad of it: John is like me and like my brothers—— 
he is quite a Gibson. Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me with 
letters for money! I have no more money to give him: we are getting 
poor, I must send away half the servants, and shut up part of the house; 
or let it off. I can never submit to do that—yet how are we to get on? 
Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of mortgages. John 
gambles dreadfully, and always loses—poor boy! He is beset by sharp- 
ers: John is sunk and degraded—his look is frightful—I feel ashamed 
for him when I see him.” 

She was getting much excited. “I think I had better leave her now,” 
said I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed. 

“Perhaps you had, miss; but she often talks in this way towards night 
—in the morning she is calmer.” 

Trose. “Stop!” exclaimed Mrs. Reed, “there is another thing I wish- 
ed to say. He threatens me—he continually threatens me with his own 
death, or mine; and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a 
great wound in his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face. I am 
come to a strange pass: I have heavy troubles. What is to be done? 
How is the money to be had?” 

Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: 
she succeeded with difficulty. Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more com- 
posed, and sank into a dozing state, I then left her. 

More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with 
her. She continued either delirious or lethargic, and the doctor forbade 
everything which could painfully excite her. Meantime, I got on as well 
as I could with Georgiana and Eliza, They were very cold, indeed, at 
first. Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and scarce-~ 
ly utter a word either to me or her sister. Georgiana would chatter non- 
sense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of me. But I 
was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or amusement: I 
had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me for 
both. 

Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to 


200 JANE EYRE 


take a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in 
sketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momen- 
tarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a 
glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing 
its disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad’s head, crowned 
with lotus-flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-spar- 
row’s nest, under a wreath of hawthorn bloom. 

One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to 
be I did not care to know. I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad 
point, and worked away. Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and 
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour 
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features. 
Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; 
then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and 
full nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a 
firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it; of course, some 
black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, 
and waved above the forehead. Now for the eyes: I had Icft them to 
the last, because they required the most careful working. I drew them 
large; I shaped them well: the eye-lashes I traced long and sombre, the 
irids lustrous and large. “Good! but not quite the thing,” I thought, as 
T surveyed the effect: “they want more force and spirit;” and I wrought 
the shades blacker, that the lights might flash morc brilliantly—~a happy 
touch or two secured success. There, I had a friend’s face under my 
gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs 
on me? I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was ab- 
sorbed and content. 

“Ts that a portrait of some one you know?” asked Eliza, who had ap- 
proached me unnoticed. I responded that it was merely a fancy head, 
and hurried it beneath the other sheets. Of course, I lied: it was, in fact, 
a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester, But what was that to 
her, or to any one but myself? Georgiana also advanced to look. The 
other drawings pleased her much, but she called that “an ugly man,” 
They both seemed surprised at my skill. I offered to sketch their por- 
traits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline. Then Georgiana pro- 
duced her album. I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this 
put her at once into good humour. She proposed a walk in the grounds. 
Before we had been oul two hours, we were deep in a confidential con- 
versation: she had favoured me with a description of the brilliant win- 
ter she had spent in London two seasons ago—of the admiration she 
had there excited—the attention she had received; and I even got hints 
of the titled conquest she had made. In the course of the afternoon and 
evening these hints were enlarged on: various sofi conversations were 


JANE EYRE 201 


reported, and sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of 
a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my bene- 
fit. The communications were renewed from day to day: they always 
ran on the same theme—herself, her loves, and woes. It was strange she 
never once adverted either to her mother’s illness, or her brother’s death, 
or the present gloomy state of the family prospects. Her mind seemed 
wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after 
dissipations to come. She passed about five minutes each day in her 
mother’s sickroom, and no more. 

Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk. I never saw 
a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what 
she did—or rather, to discover any result of her diligence. She had an 
alarm to call her up early, I know not how she occupied herself before 
breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular por- 
tions, and each hour had its allotted task. Three times a day she studied 
a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer Book. 
T asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and she 
said, “the Rubric.” Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold thread, 
the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a carpet. 
In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she informed me it 
‘was a covering for the altar of a new church lately erected near Gates- 
head. Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to working by herself 
in the kitchen garden; and one to the regulation of her accounts. She 
seemed to want no company, no conversation. I believe she was happy 
in her way—this routine sufficed for her; and nothing annoyed her so 
much, as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to vary its 
clockwork regularity. 

She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative 
than usual, that John’s conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, 
had been a source of profound affliction to her; but she had now, she 
said, settled her mind, and formed her resolution. Her own fortune she 
had taken care to secure; and when her mother died—and it was wholly 
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or 
linger long—she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a retire- 
ment where punctual habits would be permanently secured from dis~ 
turbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous world. 
I asked if Georgiana would accompany her. 

“Of course not. Georgiana and she had nothing in common; they 
never had had. She would not be burdened with her society for any con- 
sideration. Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would 
take hers.” 

Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her 
time in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dullness of the house, and 


202 JANE EYRE 


wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an in. 
vitation up to town. “It would be so much better,” she said, “if she 
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.” I 
did not ask what she méant by “all being over,” but I suppose she re- 
ferred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of 
funeral rites. Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister’s indo- 
Jence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had 
been before her. One day, however, as she put away her account-book 
and unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus,— 

“Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly 

_ never allowed to cumber the earth. You had no right to be born, for you 

make no use of life. Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a 
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some 
other person’s strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or 
himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you 
are ill-treated, neglected, miserable. Then, too, existence for you must 
be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a 
dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be flat- 
tered—you must have music, dancing, and society—or you languish, you 
die away. Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you 
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but our own? Take one day: 
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task; leave no stray 
unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes—include all; 
do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid regularity. 
The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun; and you 
are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant moment; 
you have had to seek no one’s company, conversation, sympathy, for- 
bearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to do. 
Take this advice—the first and last I shall offer you; then you will not 
want me or any one else, happen what may, Neglect it—-go on as hereto- 
fore, craving, whining, and idling—and suffer the results of your idiocy, 
however bad and insufferable they may be. I tell you this plainly; and 
listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now about to say, I 
shall steadily act on it. After my mother’s death I wash my hands of 
you; from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, 
you and I will be as separate as if we had never known cach other. You 
necd not think that because we chanced to be born of the same parents, 
I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest claim: I can 
tell you this—if the whole human race, ourselves excepted, were swept 
away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you in the old 
world, and betake myself to the new.” 

She closed her lips. 

“You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that ti- 


JANE EYRE 202 


rade,” answered Georgiana. “Everybody knows you are the most selfish, 
heartless creature in existence; and J know your spiteful hatred towards 
me, I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about 
Lord Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to 
have a title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your 
face, and so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects 
for ever.” Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for 
an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassible, and assiduously indus- 
trious. 

True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here 
were two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despic- 
ably savoutless, for the want of it, Feeling without judgment is a washy 
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and 
husky a morsel for human deglutition. 

It was a wet and windy afternoon. Georgiana had fallen asleep on the 
sofa over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint’s-day 
service at the new church—for in matters of religion she was a rigid 
formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what 
she considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church 
thrice every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers. 

I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, 
who lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a re- 
mittent attention; the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip 
out of the room whenever she could, Bessie was faithful; but she had 
her own family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall. I 
found the sickroom unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there: 
the patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the 
pillows: the fire was dying in the grate. I renewed the fuel, rearranged 
the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on me, and 
then I moved away to the window. 

The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestu- 
ously. “One lies there,” I thought, “who will soon be beyond the war 
of earthly elements. Whither will that spirit—now struggling to quit its 
material tenement—flit when at length released?” 

In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns; recalled 
her dying words—her faith—her doctrine of the equality of disembodied 
souls, I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered tones— 
still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and sublime 
gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed and whispered her longing to be 
restored to her divine Father’s bosom—when a feeble voice murmured 
from the couch behind, ‘Who is that?” 

I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving? I went 
up to her. 


204 JANE EYRE 


“Tt is I, Aunt Reed.” 

“Who—lI?” was her answer. “Who are you?” looking at me with 
surprise and a sort of alarm, but still not wildly. “You are quite a 
stranger to me—where is Bessie?” 

“She is at the lodge, aunt.” 

“Aunt,” she repeated. “Who calls me aunt? You are not one of the 
Gibsons; and yet I know you—that face, and the eyes and forehead, 
are quite familiar to me—you are like—why, you are like Jane Eyre!” 

TI said nothing; I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring 
my identity. 

“Ves,” said she, “I am afraid it is a mistake; my thoughts deceive 
me. I wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists: 
besides, in eight years she must be so changed.” I now gently assured 
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be; and see- 
ing that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I 
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield. 

“J am very ill, I know,” she said ere long. “I was trying to turn my- 
self a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb. It is as well I 
should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health bur- 
dens us at such an hour as the present is to me. Is the nurse here? or is 
there no one in the room but you?” 

I assured her we were alone, 

“Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now. One was in 
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my 
own child; the other-—” she stopped. “After all, it is of no great im- 
portance, perhaps,” she murmured to herself: “and then I may get bet- 
ter, and to humble myself so to her is painful,” 

She made an effort to alter her position, but failed. Her face changed; 
she seemed to experience some inward sensation—the precursor, per- 
haps, of the last pang. 

“Well, I must get it over. Eternity is before me: I had better tell 
her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see 
there.” , 

T obeyed her directions. “Read the letter,” she said. 

It was short, and thus conceived :— 


Mapam,—Wiill you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece, 
Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is? It is my intention to write shortly and 
desire her to come to me at Madeira. Providence has blessed my endeavors 
to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried and childless, I wish to adopt 
her during my life, and bequeath her at my death whatever I may have to 
leaye-—I am, Madam, etc., etc., 

Joun Eyre, Madeira. 


JANE EYRE 205 


It was dated three years back. 

“Why did I never hear of this?” I asked. 

“Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a 
hand in lifling you to prosperity. I could not forget your conduct to me, 
Jane—the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which 
you declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the 
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought 
of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miser- 
able cruelty. I could not forget my own sensations when you thus start- 
ed up and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an ani- 
mal that I had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes 
and cursed me in a man’s voice~—Bring me some water! Oh, make 
haste!” 

“Dear Mrs. Reed,” said I, as I offered her the draught she required, 
“think no more of all this; let it pass away from your mind, Forgive 
me for my passionate language. I was a child then; eight, nine years 
have passed since that day.” 

She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water 
and drawn breath, she went on thus,— 

“T tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be 
adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was 
what I could not endure. I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his dis- 
appointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at 
Lowood. Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion— 
expose my falsehood as soon as you like. You were born, I think, to 
be my torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed 
which, but for you, I should never have been tempted to commit.” 

“Tf you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to 
regard me with kindness and forgiveness——” 

“Vou have a very bad disposition,” said she, “and one to this day I 
feel it impossible co understand: how for nine years you could be pa- 
tient and quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all 
fire and violence, I can never comprehend.” 

“My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not 
vindictive. Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to Jove 
you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled to 
you now: kiss me, aunt.” 

I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it, She said 
I oppressed her by leaning over the béd, and again demanded water. As 
I faid her down—for I raised her and supported her on my arm while 
she drank—I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the 
feeble fingers shrank from my touch—the glazing eyes shunned my gaze- 


206 JANE EYRE 


“Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,” I said at last, “you have my 
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God’s, and be at peace.” 

Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort 
to change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me; 
dying, she must hate me still. 

The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed. I yet lingered half an 
hour longer, hoping to see some sign of amity; but she gave none. She 
was fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve 
o'clock that night she died. I was not present to close her eyes, nor was 
either of her daughters. They came to tell us the next morning that all 
was over. She was by that time laid out. Eliza and I went to look at 
her; Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared not 
go. There was stretched Sarah Reed’s once robust and active frame, 
tigid and still; her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow 
and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul. A strange 
and solemn object was that corpse to me. I gazed on it with gloom and 
pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or sub- 
duing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for ker woes—not my loss— 
and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a form, 
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly. After a silence of some minutes she 
observed -— 

“With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her 
life was shortened by trouble.” And then a spasm constricted her mouth 
for an instant: as it passed away she tumed and left the room, and so 
did I. Neither of us had dropped a tear. 


CHAPTER XXII 


Mr, RocHester had given me but one week's leave of absence, yet a 
month elapsed before I quitted Gateshead. I wishea to leave immedi- 
ately after the funeral; but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could 
get off to London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, 
Mr. Gibson, who had come down to direct his sister’s interment and 
settle the family affairs, Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone 
with Eliza; from her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support 
in her fears, nor aid in her preparations: so I bore with her fecble-mind- 
ed wailings and selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best 
in sewing for her and packing her dresses. It is true that while I worked 
she would idle; and I thought to myself, “If you and I were destined to 
live always together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different 
footing. I should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing 
party; I should assign you your share of labour, and compel you to ac- 


JANE EYRE 207 


complish it, or else it should be left undone. I should insist also on your 
keeping some of those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in 
your own breast. It is only because our connection happens to be very 
transitory, and comes at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent 
thus to render it so patient and compliant on my part.” 

At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza’s turn to request me 
to stay another week. Her plans required all her time and attention, she 
said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day 
long she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks, 
emplying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with 
any one. She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and 
answer notes of condolence. 

One morning she told me I was at liberty. “And,” she added, “I am 
obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct! There is 
some difference between living with such an one as you and with Georgi- 
ana: you perform your own part in life, and burden no one. To-mor- 
row,” she continued, “I set out for the Continent. I shall take up my 
abode in a religious house near Lisle—-a nunnery you would call it; there 
I shall be quiet and unmolested. I shall devote myself for a time to the 
examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study of 
the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it is, the 
one best calculated to insure the doings of all things decently and in 
order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the veil.” 

I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dis- 
suade her from it. “The vocation will fit you to a hair,” I thought: 
“much good may it do you!” 

When we parted, she said, “Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you 
well: you have some sense.” 

I then returned: ‘You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what 
you have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French 
convent. However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don’t 
much care,” 

“Vou are in the right,” said she; and with these words we each went 
our separate way. As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or 
her sister again, I may as well mention here that Georgiana made an ad- 
vantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that 
Eliza actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent 
where she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed 
with her fortune, 

How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long 
or short, I did not know; I had never experienced the sensation, I had 
known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long 
walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was 


208 JANE EYRE 


to come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and 
a good fire, and to be unable to get either. Neither of these returnings 
was very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point, in- 
creasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came, The return to 
Thornfield was yet to be tricd. 

My journey seemed tedious—very tedious: fifty miles one day, a 
night spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day. During the first twelve 
hours I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured 
and discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice. I mused on 
the funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and ser- 
vants—few was the number of relatives—the gaping vault, the silent 
church, the solemn service. Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana. J 
beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a con- 
vent cell; and I dwelt on and analyzed their separate peculiarities of 
person and character. The evening arrival at the great town of —— 
scattered these thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down 
on my traveller’s bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation. 

I was going back to Thornfield; but how long was I to stay there? 
Not long; of that I was sure. I had heard from Mrs, Fairfax in the in- 
terim of my absence. The party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Roch- 
ester had left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to 
return in a fortnight. Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make 
arrangements for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new 
carriage. She said the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed 
strange to her; but from what everybody said, and from what she had 
herself seen, she could no longer doubt that the event would shortly 
take place, “You would be strangely incredulous if you did doubt it,” 
was my mental comment. “I don’t doubt it.” 

The question followed, “Where was I to go?” I dreamt of Miss In- 
gram all the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates 
of Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr, 
Rochester looked on with his arms folded—smiling sardonically, as it 
seemed, at both her and me. 

T had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return, for I 
did not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote. I proposed 
to walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving 
my box in the hostler’s care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about 
six o’clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield—a 
road which lay chiefly through fields, and was now litile frequented. 

It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft. 
The haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far 
from cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue— 
where blue was visible—was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high 


JANE EYRE 209 


and thin, The west, too, was warm. No watery gleam chilled it: it seem: 
ed as if there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled 
vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness. 

I felt glad as the road shortened before me—so glad that I stopped 
once to ask myself what that joy meant, and to remind reason that it 
was not to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to 
a place where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival. 
“Mrs. Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure,” said J; “and 
little Adéle will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very 
well you are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking 
of you.” 

But what is so headstrong as youth? what so blind as inexperience? 
These affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again 
looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they 
added, “Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more 
days or weeks at most, and you are parted from him for ever!” And 
then I strangled a new-born agony—a deformed thing which I could not 
persuade myself to own and rear—and ran on. 

They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the la- 
bourers are just quitting their work, and returning home with their 
rakes on their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive. I have but a field or 
two to traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates, 
How full the hedges are of roses! But I have no time to gather any; I 
want to be at the house. I passed a tall brier, shooting leafy and flowery 
branches across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I 
see—Mr. Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand: he is 
writing, 

Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a mo~ 
ment I am beyond my own mastery. What does it mean? I did not 
think I should tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or 
the power of motion in his presence. I will go back as soon as I can 
stir; I need not make an absolute fool of myself. I know another way 
to the house. It does not signify if I knew twenty ways, for he has seen 
me. 

“Fillo!” he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil. “There you 
are! Come on, if you please.” 

I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not, being 
scarcely cognizant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear 
calm, and, above all, to control the working muscles of my face, which I 
feel rebel insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had 
resolved to conceal, But I have a veil—it is down: I may make shift 
yet to behave with decent composure. 

“And this is Jane Eyre? Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot? 


210 JANE EYRE 


YVes—just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come clat- 
tering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into the 
vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a dream 
or a shade. What the deuce have you done with yourself this last 
month?” 

“Y have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead.” 

“A true Janian reply! Good angels be my guard! She comes from 
the other world—from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me 
so when she meets me alone here in the gloaming! If I dared, I’d touch 
you, to see if you are strbstance or shadow, you elf!—but I’d as soon 
offer to take hold of a blue ignis fatuus light in a marsh. Truant! 
truant!” he added, when he had paused an instant. “Absent from me a 
whole month, and forgetting me quite, V'll be sworn!” 

I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even 
though broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, 
and by the knowledge that I was nothing to him; but there was ever in 
Mr. Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of 
communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered 
to stray and stranger birds like me was to feast genially, His last words 
were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him 
whether I forgot him or not. And he had spoken of Thornfield as my 
home-—would that it were my home! 

He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by. I in- 
quired soon if he had not been to London. 

“Ves; I suppose you found that out by second-sight.” 

“Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter.” 

“And did she inform you what I went to do?” 

“Oh yes, sir! Everybody knew your errand.” 

“You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don’t think it will 
suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen 
Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions. I wish, Jane, I 
were a trifle better adapted {9 match with her externally. Tell me now, 
fairy as you are—can’t you give me a charm, or a philter, or something 
of that sort, to make me a handsome man?” 

“Tt would be past the power of magic, sir;” and, in thought, I added, 
“A loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome 
enough; or rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty.” 

Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an 
acumen to me incomprehensible. In the present instance he took no 
notice of my abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain 
smile he had of his own, and which he used but on rare occasions. He 
seemed to think it too good for common purposes: it wae the real sun- 
shine of feeling—he shed it over me now. 


JANE EYRE 211 


“Pass, Janet,” said he, making room for me to cross the stile: “go up 
home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend’s threshold.” 

All T had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to 
colloquize further. I got over the stile without a word, and meant to 
leave him calmly. An impulse held me fast—a force turned me round. 
I said—or something in me said for me, and in spite of me,— 

“Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness, I am strangely 
glad to get back again to you; and wherever you are is my home—my 
only home.” 

T walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had 
he tried. Little Adéle was half wild with delight when she saw me. Mrs. 
Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness. Leah smiled, and 
even Sophie bid me “bon soir” with glee. This was very pleasant: there 
is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and 
feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort. 

I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future; I stopped 
my ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and 
coming grief. When tea was over, and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her 
knitting, and I had assumed a low seat near her, and Adéle, kneeling 
on the carpet, had nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affec- 
tion seemed to surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a si- 
lent prayer that we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we 
thus sat, Mr. Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seem- 
ed to take pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable~—when he 
said he supposed the old Jady was all right now that she had got her 
adopted daughter back again, and added that he saw Adéle was “préte & 
croquer sa petite maman Anglaise”’—I half ventured to hope that he 
would, even after his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the 
shelter of his protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his 
presence. 

A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my retuin to Thornfield Hall. 
Nothing was said of the master’s marriage, and I saw no preparation go- 
ing on for such an event, Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she 
had yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the nega- 
tive. Once she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester 
as to when he was going to -bring his bride home; but he had answered 
her only by a joke and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell 
what to make of him. 

One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no jour- 
neyings backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park, To be sure it 
was twenty miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was 
that distance to an ardent lover? To so practised and indefatigable a 
horseman as Mr. Rochester, it would be but a morning’s ride, I began 


212 JANE EYRE 


to cherish hopes I had no right to conceive: that the match was broken 
off; that rumour had been mistaken; that one or both parties had chang- 
ed their minds. I used to look at my master’s face to see if it were sad 
or fierce; but I could not remember the time when it had been so uni- 
formly clear of clouds or evil feelings. If, in the moments I and my 
pupil spent with him, I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, 
he became even gay. Never had he called me more frequently to his 
presence; never been kinder to me when there; and, alas! never had I 
loved him so well. 


CHAPTER XXIII 


A sPLenpin midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radi- 
ant as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour, even singly, our 
wave-girt land. It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the 
south, like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them 
on the cliffs of Albion. The hay was all got in; the fields round Thorn- 
field were green and shorn, the roads white and baked; the trees were in 
their dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply-tinted, con- 
trasted well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between. 

On Midsummer-eve, Adéle, weary with gathering wild strawberries 
in Hay Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun. I watched her 
drop asleep, and when I left her I sought the garden. 

It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:—~“Day its fervid 
fires had wasted,” and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched sum- 
mit. Where the sun had gone down in simple state—pure of the pomp 
of clouds—spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel 
and furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and 
wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven. The east had its own charm 
of fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a rising and solitary star: 
soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon. 

I walked awhile on the pavement. But a subtle, well-known scent-— 
that of a cigar-——stole from some window; I saw the library casement 
open a handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence, so I went apart 
into the orchard. No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more 
Eden-like. It was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers. A very high 
wall shut it out from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue 
screened it from the lawn. At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole 
separation from lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and 
terminating in a giant horse-chestnut circled at the base by a seat, led 
down to the fence, Here one could wander unseen, While such honey-~ 
dew fell, such silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I 


JANE EYRE 213 


could haunt such shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit 
parterres at the upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light 
the now rising moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed— 
not by sound, not by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance. 

Sweet-brier and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long 
been yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither 
of shrub nor flower; it is—I know it well—it is Mr. Rochester’s cigar. 
I look round and listen. I see trees laden with ripening fruit, I hear a 
nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is visible, 
no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee. I make 
for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester enter- 
ing. I step aside into the ivy recess: he will not stay long; he will soon 
return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me. 

But no—eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique 
garden as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree 
branches to look at the fruit, Jarge as plums, with which they are Jaden; 
now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of 
flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on 
their petals. A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at 
Mr. Rochester’s foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it, 

“Now, he has his back towards me,” thought I, “and he is occupied 
too; perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed.” 

I trod on an edging of turf, that the crackle of the pebbly gravel 
might not betray me. He was standing among the beds at a yard or two 
distant from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him, “T 
shall get by very well,” I meditated. As I crossed his shadow, thrown 
long over the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, 
without turning,— 

“Jane, come and Jook at this fellow.” 

I had made no noise; he had not eyes behind—could his shadow feel? 
I started at first, and then I approached him. 

‘Look at his wings,” said he: “he reminds me rather of a West In- 
dian insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in 
England. There! he is flown.” 

The moth roamed away. I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr. 
Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said,— 

“Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and 
surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with 
moonrise.” 

It is one of my faults that, though my tongue is sometimes prompt 
enough at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing 
an excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile 
word or plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful 


214 JANE EVRE 


embarrassment. I did not like 1o walk at this hour alone with Mr. Roch- 
ester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege for 
leaving him. I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent on 
discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed 
and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil— 
if evil existent or prospective there was—seemed to lie with me only; 
his mind was unconscious and quiet. 

“Jane,” he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly 
strayed down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut, 
“Thomfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?” 

“Yes, sit.” 

“You must have become in some degree attached to the house—you, 
who have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of 
Adhesiveness?” 

“TI am attached to it, indeed.” 

“And though I don’t comprehend how it is, I perceive you have ac- 
quired a degree of regard for that foolish little child Adéle, too; and 
even for simple dame Fairfax?” 

“Ves, sir; in different ways I have an affection for both.” 

“And would be sorry to part with them?” 

“Ves.” 

“Pity!” he said, and sighed and paused. “It is always the way of 
events in this life,” he continued presently: “no sooner have you got 
settled in a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise 
and move on, for the hour of repose is expired.” 

“Must I move on, sir?” I asked. “Must I leave Thornfield?” 

“T believe you must, Jane. Tam sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you 
must.” 

This was a blow; but I did not let it prostrate me. 

“Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes.” 

“It is come now—I must give it to-night.” 

“Then you are going to be married, sir?” 

“FEx-act-ly—~pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the 
nail straight on the head.” 

“Soon, sir?” 

“Very soon, my--—that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, 
the first time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my in- 
tention to put my old bachelor’s neck into the sacred noose, to enter 
into the holy estate of matrimony—to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, 
in short (she’s an extensive armful: but that’s not to the point—one 
can’t have too much of such a very excellent thing as my beautiful 
Blanche): well, as I was saying—listen to me, Jane! You're not turning 
your head to look after more moths, are you? That was only a lady- 


JANE EYRE 218 


clock, child, ‘flying away home.’ I wish to remind you that it was you 
who first said to me, with that discretion I respect in you—with that 
foresight, prudence, and humility which befit your responsible and de- 
pendent position—that in case I married Miss -Ingram, both you 
and little Adéle had better trot forthwith. I pass over the sort 
of slur conveyed in this suggestion on the character of my beloved; in- 
deed, when you are far away, Janet, I’ll try to forget it—I shall notice 
only its wisdom, which is such that I have made it my law of action. 
Adéle must go to school; and you, Miss Eyre, must get a new situation.” 

“Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately; and meantime, I suppose——” 
I was going to say, “I suppose I may stay here till I find another shelter 
to betake myself to;” but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a 
long sentence, for my voice was not quite under command. 

‘Tn about a month I hope to be a bridegroom,” continued Mr. Roch- 
ester; “and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and 
an asylum for you.” 

“Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give-——” 

“Oh, no need to apologize! I consider that when a dependant does her 
duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her 
employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; in- 
deed I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place 
that I think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daugh- 
ters of Mrs. Dionysius O’Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland. 
You'll like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, 
they say.” 

“Tt is a long way off, sir.” 

“No matter—a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the 
distance,” 

“Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier-——” 

“From what, Jane?” 

“From England and from Thornfield—and———” 

“Well?” 

“From ‘you, sir.” 

I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free 
will, my tears gushed out. I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I 
avoided sobbing. The thought of Mrs. O’Gall and Bitternutt Lodge 
struck cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and 
foam destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at 
whose side I now walked; and coldest the remembrance of the wider 
ocean—wealth, caste, custom—intervened between me and what I natu- 
rally and inevitably loved. 

“Tt is a long way,” I again said, 

“It is, to be sure; and wher you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, 


216 JANE EYRE 


Treland, I shall never see you again, Janc—that’s morally certain. T 
never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the 
country. We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?” 

“Ves, sir.” 

“And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend 
the little time that remains to them close to each other. Come! we'll 
talk over the voyage and the parting quietly half an hour or so, while 
the stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder. Here is the 
chestnut tree; here is the bench at its old roots. Come, we will sit there 
in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit there 
together.” He seated me and himself. 

« “tt is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little 
friend on such weary travels; but if I can’t do better, how is it to be 
helped? Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?” 

fT could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was full. 

“Because,” he said, “I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard 
to you—especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I hada 
string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to 
a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little 
frame. And if that boisterous Channel and two hundred miles or so of 
land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will 
be snapt; and then I’ve a nervous notion I should take {o bleeding in~ 
wardly. As for you,—you’d forget me.” 

“That I sever should, sir: you know——~” Impossible to proceed. 

“Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood? Listen!” 

In Hstening, I sobbed convulsively, for I could repress what I en- 
dured no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to 
foot with acute distress. When I did speak, it was only to express an 
impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thorn- 
field. 

“Because you are sorry to leave it?” 

The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was 
claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to 
predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,—-and to 
speak. 

“Y grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:—I love it, because I 
have lived in it a full and delightful life—momentarily at least. I have 
not been trampled on. I have not been petrified. I have not been buried 
with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion 
with what is bright and energetic and high. I have talked, face to face, 
with what I reverence, with what I delight in—with an original, a vig- 
orous, an expanded mind. I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it 
strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn 


JANE EYRE 217 


from you for ever. I see the necessity of departure; and it is like look- 
ing on the necessity of death.” 

“Where do you see the necessity?” he asked suddenly. 

“Where? You, sir, have placed it before me.” 

“In what shape?” 

“In the shape of Miss Ingram—a noble and beautiful woman—your 
bride.” 

“My bride! What bride? I have no bride!” 

“But you will have.” 

“VYes:—I will!—tI will!” He set his teeth. 

“Then I must go:—you have said it yourself.” 

“No; you must stay! I swear it—and the oath shall be kept.” 

“T tell you I must go!” I retorted, roused to something like passion. 
“Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you think I 
am an automaton? —a machine without feelings? and can bear to have 
my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water 
dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, 
and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong!—I have as 
mich saul as you-—and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me 
with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for 
you to leave me as it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to 
you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of 
mortal flesh; —it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both 
had passed through the grave, and we stood at God’s feet, equal-—as we 
are!” 

“As we are!” repeated Mr. Rochester—‘“so,” he added, enclosing me 
in his arms, gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: “‘so, 
Jane!” 

“Ves, so, sir,” I rejoined: “and yet not so; for you are a married man 
—or as good as a matried man; and wed to one inferior to you—to one 
with whom you have no sympathy—whom I do not believe you truly 
love, for I have seen and heard you sneer at her. I would scorn such a 
union: therefore I am better than you—let me go!” 

“Where, Jane? To Ireland?” 

“Ves,—to Ireland. I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere 
now.” 

“Jane“be still; don’t struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rend- 
ing its own plumage in its desperation.” 

“Tam no bird, and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with 
an independent will, which I now exert to leave you,” 

Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him, 

“And your will shall decide your destiny,” he said: “I offer you my 
hand. my heart, and a share of all my possessions.” 


218 JANE EYRE 


“Vou play a farce, which I merely laugh at.” 

“T ask you to pass through life at my side—to be my second self, and 
best earthly companion.” 

“For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide 
by it.” 

“Jane, be still a few moments—you are over-excited: I will be still 
too.” 

A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel walk and trembling 
through the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away—away-~to an 
indefinite distance—it died, The nightingale’s song was then the only 
voice of the hour: in listening to it, I again wept. Mr. Rochester sat 
quiet, looking at me gently and seriously. Some time passed before he 
spoke; he at last said,— 

“Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one an- 
other,” 

“{ will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and can- 
not return.” 

“But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to 
marry.” 

T was silent: I thought he mocked me. 

“Come, Jane—come hither.” 

“Vour bride stands between us.” 

He rose, and with a stride reached me. 

“My bride is here,” he said, again drawing me to him, “because my 
equal is here, and my likeness. Jane, will you marry me?” 

Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp, for I 
was still incredulous, 

“Do you doubt me, Jane?” 

“Entirely.” 

“You have no faith in me?” 

“Not a whit.” 

“Am I a liar in your eyes?” he asked passionately. “Little sceptic, 
you s/all be convinced. What love have I for Miss Ingram? None— 
and that you know. What love has she for me? None—as I have taken 
pains to prove. I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not 
a third of what was supposed; and after that I presented myself to see 
the result: it was coldness both from her and her mother. I would not 
—I could not—marry Miss Ingram. You—you strange, you almost 
unearthly thing !—I love as my own flesh. You—poor and obscure, and 
small and plain as you are—~I entreat to accept me as a husband.” 

“What, me!” I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness—and especi- 
ally in his incivility—to credit his sincerity: “me who have not a friend 


JANE EYRE 219 


in the world but you—if you are my friend; not a shilling but what you 
have given me?” 

“You, Jane. I must have you for my own—entirely my own. Will 
you be mine? Say yes, quickly.” 

“Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight.” 

“Why?” 

“Because I want to read your countenance—tum!” 

“There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, 
scratched page. Read on: only make haste, for I suffer.” 

His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there 
were strong workings in the features and strange gleams in the eyes. 

“Q Jane, you torture me!” he exclaimed. “With that searching and 
yet faithful and generous look, you torture me!” 

“How can I do that? If you are true, and your offer real, my only 
feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion—they cannot torture.” 

“Gratitude!” he ejaculated; and added wildly—‘Janc, accept me 
quickly. Say, Edward—give me my name-—-Edward, I will marry you.” 

“Are you in earnest? Do you truly love me? Do you sincerely wish 
me to be your wife?” 

“T do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it.”” 

“Then, sir, I will marry you.” 

“Edward—my little wife!” 

“Dear Edward!” 

“Come to me—come to me entirely now,” said he; and added, in his 
deepest tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, “Make 
my happiness—I will make yours.” 

“God pardon me!” he subjoined ere long; “and man meddle not with 
me: I have her, and will hold her.” 

“There is no one to meddle, sir. I have no kindred to interfere.” 

“No—that is the best of it,” he said. And if 1 had loved him less, I 
should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but, sit- 
ting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting—called to the para~ 
dise of union—I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so 
abundant a flow. Again and again he said, “Are you happy, Jane?” And 
again and again I answered, “Yes.” After which he murmured, “It will 
atone—it will atone. Have I not found her friendiess, and cold, and 
comfortless? Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her? Is there 
not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves? It will expiate at 
God’s tribunal. I know my Maker sanctions what I do, For the world’s 
judgment—I wash my hands thereof, For man’s opinion—I defy it,” 

But what had befallen the night? The moon was not yet set, and we 
were all in shadow. I could scarcely see my master’s face, near as I 
was. And what ailed the chestnut tree?—it writhed and groaned; while 


220 JANE EYRE 


wind roared in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us. 

“We must go in,” said Mr. Rochester; “the weather changes, I could 
have sat with thee till morning, Jane.” 

“And so,” thought I, “could I with you.” I should have said so, per~ 
haps, but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, 
and there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought 
only of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester’s shoulder. 

The rain rushed down. He hurried me up the walk, through the 
grounds, and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could 
pass the threshold. He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking 
the water out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her 
room. I did not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester. The lamp 
was lit. The clock was on the stroke of twelve. 

“Fasten to take off your wet things,” said he; “and before you go, 
good-night—good-night, my darling!” 

He kissed me repeatedly. When I looked up, on leaving his arms, 
there stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed. I only smiled at her, 
and ran upstairs. “Explanation will do for another time,” thought I. 
Still, when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should 
even temporarily misconstrue what she had seen, But joy soon effaced 
every other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the 
thunder crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract- 
like as the rain fell during a storm of two hours’ duration, I experienced 
no fear and little awe, Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the 
course of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil; and that was comfort, that 
was strength for anything. 

Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adéle came running in to 
tell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had 
been struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away, 


CHAPTER XXIV 


As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered 
if it were a dream. I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen 
Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and prom- 
ise. 
While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it 
was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour; 
and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and 
borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple. I had often been unwilling to 
look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my 
look; but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his 


JANE EYRE 221 


affection by its expression. I took a plain but clean and light summer 
dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well 
become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood. 

I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a bril- 
liant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to 
feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant 
breeze. Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy. A beggar-wo- 
man and her little boy—pale, ragged objects both—were coming up the 
walk, and I ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have 
in my purse—some three or four shillings: good or bad, they must par 
take of my jubilee. The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but noth- 
ing was so merry or so musical as my own rejoicing heart. 

Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad 
countenance, and saying gravely, “Miss Eyre, will you come to break- 
fast?” During the meal she was quiet and cool; but I could not unde- 
ceive her then. I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so 
must she. I ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs. I met Adéle 
leaving the schoolroom. 

“Where are you going? It is time for Icssons.” 

“Mr, Rochester has sent me away to the nursery.” 

“Where is he?” 

“In there,” pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, 
and there he stood, 

“Come and bid me good-morning,” said he. I gladly advanced; and 
it was not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand, that I 
received, but an embrace and a kiss. It seemed natural—it seemed genial 
to be so well loved, so caressed by him. 

“Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty,” said he—“truly 
pretty this morning. Is this my pale, little elf? Is this my mustard- 
seed? This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips; 
the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?” (I had green 
eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were new- 
dyed, I suppose.) 

“Tt is Jane Eyre, sir.” 

“Soon to be Jane Rochester,” he added: “in four weeks, Janet; not a 
day more. Do you hear that?” 

I did, and I could not quite comprehend it; it made me giddy. The 
feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than 
was consistent with joy—something that smote and stunned: it was, I 
think, almost fear. 

“You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?” 

“Because you gave me a new name—Jane Rochester; and it seems 
so strange” 


222 JANE EYRE 


“Ves, Mrs. Rochester,” said he; “young Mrs. Rochester—Fairfax 
Rochester’s girl-bride.” 

“Tt can never be, sir; it does not sound likely. Human beings never 
enjoy complete happiness in this world. I was born for a different des- 
tiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is a 
fairy tale—a day-dream.” 

“Which I can and will realize. I shall begin to-day. This morning T 
wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his 
keeping—heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield. In a day or two I hope 
to pour them into your lap; for every privilege, every attention shall be 
yours that I would accord a peer’s daughter, if about to marry her.” 

“Oh, sir!--never mind jewels! I don’t like to hear them spoken of. 
Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange. I would rather not 
have them.” 

“JT will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet 
on your forehead, which it will become—for nature, at least, has stamp- 
ed her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the brace- 
lets on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings.” 

“No, no, sir! Think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and 
in another strain. Don’t address me as if 1 were a beauty; I am your 
plain, Quakerish governess.” 

“You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of 
my heart-—delicate and aerial.” 

“Puny and insignificant, you mean. You are dreaming, sir—or you 
are sheering. For God’s sake, don’t be ironical!” 

“T will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too,” he went on, 
while I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I 
felt he was either deluding himself or trying to delude me. “I will attire 
my Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will 
cover the head I love best with a priceless veil.” 

“And then you won’t know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane 
Eyre any longer, but an ape in a harlequin’s jacket—a jay in borrowed 
plumes, I would as soon sce you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage- 
trappings, as myself clad in a court-lady’s robe; and I don’t call you 
handsome, six, though I love you most dearly—far too dearly to flatter 
you. Don’t flatter me.” 

He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation. 
“This very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must 
choose some dresses for yourself, I told you we shall be married in 
four weeks. The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down 
below yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town. After a 
brief stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun—to 
French vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is fa- 


JANE EYRE 223 


mous in old story and in modern record. She shall taste, too, of the life 
of cities; and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with 
others.” 

“Shall I travel?—and with you, sir?” 

“You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples—at Florence, Venice, 
and Vienna. All the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden 
by you: wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph’s foot shall step also. 
Ten years since J flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and 
rage as my companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with 
a very angel as my comforter.” 

I laughed at him as he said this. “I am not an angel,” I asserted; 
“and I will not be one till I die: I will be myself. Mr. Rochester, you 
must neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me—for you will not 
get it, any more than J shall get it of you, which I do not at all antici- 
pate,” 

“What do you anticipate of me?” 

“For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now—a very little 
while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and 
then you will be stern, and J shall have much ado to please you. But 
when you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again—like me, 
I say, not Jove me. I suppose your love will effervesce in six months, or 
less. I have observed, in books written by men, that period assigned as 
the farthest to which a husband’s ardour extends. Yet, after all, as a 
friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my 
dear master.” 

“Distasteful! and like you again! I think I shall like you again, and 
yet again; and I will make you confess I do not only like but love you— 
with truth, fervour, constancy.” 

“Vet are you not capricious, sir?” 

“To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil 
when I find out they have neither souls nor hearts—when they open to 
me a perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarse- 
ness, and ill-temper; but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the 
soul made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break—at 
once supple and stable, tractable and consistent—I am ever tender and 
true.” 

“Had you ever experience of such a character, sir? Did you ever love 
such an one?” 

“T love it now.” 

“But before me—if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult 
standard?” 

“I never met your likeness, Jane, you please me, and you master me; 
you seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and 


224 JANE EYRE 


while I am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a 
thrill up my arm to my heart. I am influenced—conquered; and the in- 
fluence is sweeter than I can express, and the conquest I undergo has a 
witchery beyond any triumph I can win. Why do you smile, Jane? 
What does that inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?” 

“I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary)— 
T was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers 

“You were, you little elfish-——” 

“Flush, sit! You don’t talk very wisely just now—any more than 
those gentlemen acted very wisely. However, had they been married, 
they would no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for 
their softness as suitors; and so will you, I fear. I wonder how you will 
answer me a year hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your 
convenience or pleasure to grant.” 

“Ask me something now, Janet—the least thing. I desire to be en- 
treated: 

“Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready.” 

“Speak! But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall 
swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of 
me,” 

“Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don’t send for the jewels, and don’t 
crown me with roses. You might as well put a border of gold lace round 
that plain pocket-handkerchief you have there.” 

“T might as well ‘gild refined gold.’ I know it: your request is granted, 
then—for the time. I will remand the order I dispatched to my banker. 
But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be 
withdrawn: try again, ” 

“Well, then, sir, have the goodness ss gratify my curiosity, which is 
much piqued on one point,” 

He looked disturbed. ‘What? what?” he said hastily. “Curiosity is 
a dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every 
request: 

“But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir.” 

“Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, per- 
haps, a secret, it was a wish for half my estate.” 

“Now, King Ahasuerus! what do I want with half your estate? Do 
you think Iam a Jew-usurer, secking good investment in land? I would 
much rather have all your confidence. You will not exclude me from 
your confidence if you admit me to your heart?” 

“You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; 
but, for God’s sake, don’t desire a useless burden! Don’t long for 
poison—don’t turn out a downright Eve on my hands!” 

“Why not, sir? You have just been telling me how much you liked to 


JANE EVRE 225 


be conquered, and how pleasant overpersuasion is to you. Dont you 
think I had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax 
and entreat—even cry and be sulky, if necessary—for the sake of a mere 
essay of my power?” 

“I dare you to any such experiment. Encroach, presume, and the 
game is up.” 

“Ts it, sir? You soon give in. How stern you look now! Your eye- 
brows become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, 
in some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, ‘a blue-piled thunder- 
loft.’ That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?” 

“Tf that will be your married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give up 
the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander. But what had 
you to ask, thing?—out with it!” 

“There, you are less than civil now, and I like mdeness a great deal 
better than flattery. I had rather be a ¢Aimg than an angel. This is what 
I have to ask——Why did you take such pains to make me believe you 
wished to marry Miss Ingram?” 

“Ts that all? Thank God it is no worse!” And now he unknit his 
black brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if 
well pleased at secing a danger averted. “I think I may confess,” he 
continued, “even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane— 
and I have seen what a fire-sprite you can be when you are indignant. 
You glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against 
fate, and claimed your rank as my equal. Janet, by-the-bye, it was you 
who made me the offer.” 

“Of course I did. But to the point, if you please, sir—Miss Ingram?” 

“Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render 
you ag madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy 
would be the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end.” 

“Excellent! Now you are small—not one whit bigger than the end of 
my little finger. It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to 
act in that way. Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram’s feelings, sir?” 

“Fler feelings are concentrated in one—pride; and that needs humb- 
ling. Were you jealous, Jane?” 

“Never mind, Mr. Rochester—it is in no way interesting to you to 
know that. Answer me truly once more: Do you think Miss Ingram will 
not suffer from your dishonest coquetry? Won't she feel forsaken and 
deserted?” 

“Impossible !—when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted 
me: the idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame 
in a moment.” 

“You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester. I am afraid 
your principles on some points are eccentric.” 


226 JANE EYRE 


“My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a 
little awry for want of attention.” 

“Once again, seriously: May I enjoy the great good that has been 
vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the bit- 
ter pain I myself felt a while ago?” 

“That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the 
world has the same pure love for me as yourself; for I lay that pleasant 
unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection.” 

' T turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder. I loved him 
very much—more than I could trust myself to say—more than words 
had power to express. 

“Ask something more,” he said presently; “it is my delight to be 
entreated, and to yield.” 

J was again ready with my request. “Communicate your intentions to 
Mrs, Fairfax, sir. She saw me with you Jast night in the hall, and she 
was shocked, Give her some explanation before I see her again, It paing 
me to be misjudged by so good a woman.” 

“Go to your room, and put on your bonnet,” he replied. “I mean you 
to accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for 
the drive, I will enlighten the old lady’s understanding. Did she think, 
Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?” 

“I believe she thought J had forgotten my station, and yours, sir.” 

“Station! station!-—your station is in my heart, and on the necks of 
those who would insult you, now or hereafter. Go.” 

I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr, Rochester quit Mrs. Fair- 
fax’s parlour, I hurried down to it, The old lady had been reading her 
morning portion of Scripture—the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay 
open before her, and her spectacles were upon it. Her occupation, sus- 
pended by Mr, Rochester’s announcement, seemed now forgotten: her 
eyes, fixed on the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet 
mind stirred by unwonted tidings, Secing me, she roused herself, She 
made a sort of effort to smile, and framed a few words of congralula- 
tion; but the smile expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished. 
She put up her spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back 
from. the table. 

“I feel so astonished,” she began, “I hardly know what to say to you, 
Miss Eyre, I have surely not been dreaming, have 1? Sometimes I half 
fall asleep when I am sitting alone, and fancy things thal have never 
happened. It has seemed to me more than once when I have been ina 
doze that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in 
and sat down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my 
name, Alice, as he used to do. Now, can you tell me whether it is actu- 
ally true that Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him? Don’t laugh 


JANE EYRE 227 


at me. But I really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said 
that in a month you would be his wife.” 

“He has said the same thing to me,’ I replied. 

“He has! Do you believe him? Have you accepted him?” 

“Yes.” ry yt 

She looked at me bewildered. 4, 4 - 2 27 

“T could never have thought it. He is a proud man—all the Roch- 
esters were proud—and his father, at least, liked money. He, too, haa 
always been called careful. He means to marry you?’ 

“Fe tells me so.” 

She surveyed my whole person. In her eyes I read that they had 
there found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma. . 

“Tt passes me!” she continued; “but no doubt it is true, since you say 
so, How it will answer, I cannot tell—I really don’t know, Equality of 
position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are 
twenty years of difference in your ages, He might almost be your 
father.” 

“No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!” exclaimed I, nettled; “he is nothing like 
my father! No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an in- 
stant. Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at 
five-and-twenty.” 

“Ts it really for love he is going to marry you?” she asked. 

I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism that the tears rose to my 
eyes. 

“T am sorry to grieve you,” pursued the widow; “but you are so 
young, and so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your 
guard. It is an old saying that ‘All is not gold that glitters;’ and in this 
case I do fear there will be something found to be different from what 
either you or I expect.” 

“Why?—am Ia monster?” I said. “Ts it impossible that Mr. Roch- 
ester should have a sincere affection for me?” 

“No: you are very well, and much improved of late; and Mr. Roch- 
ester, I dare say, is fond of you. I have always noticed that you were 
a sort of pet of his. There are times when, for your sake, I have been a 
little uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on 
your guard; but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong. 
I knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so 
discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be 
trusted to protect yourself. Last night I cannot tell you what I suf- 
fered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere, 
nor the master either; and then, at twelve o’clock, saw you come in with 
him, ” 


228 JANE EYRE 


“Well, never mind that now,” I interrupted impatiently; “it is enough 
that all was right.” 

“T hope all will be right in the end,” she said; “but believe me, you 
cannot be too careful. Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance; dis- 
trust yourself as well as him. Gentlemen in his station are not ac- 
customed to marry their governesses.” 

I was growing truly irritated. Happily, Adéle ran in. 

“Let me go—let me go to Millcote too!” she cried. “Mr. Rochester 
won’t—though there is so much room in the new carriage. Beg him tq 
let me go, mademoiselle.” 

“That I will, Adéle;” and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my 
gloomy monitress. The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round 
to the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following 
him backwards and forwards, 

“Adéle may accompany us, may she not, sir?” 

“T told her no. I’ll have no brats!—Ul have only you.” 

“Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better.” 

“Not it; she will be a restraint.” 

He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice, The chill of Mrs. 
Fairfax’s warnings and the damp of her doubts were upon me: some- 
thing of unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes. I half 
lost the sense of power over him, I was about mechanically to obey him, 
without further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, 
he looked at my face. 

“What is the matter?” he asked—“all the sunshine is gone, Do you 
really wish the bairn to go? Will it annoy you if she is left behind?” 

“J would far rather she went, sir.” 

“Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!” cried 
he to Adale. 

She obeyed him with what speed she might. 

“After all, a single morning’s interruption will not matter much,” 
said he, “when I mean shortly to claim you—your thoughts, conversa- 
tion, and company—~for life.” 

Adéle, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing 
her gratitude for my intercession. She was instantly stowed away into 
a corner on the other side of him, She then peeped round to where I 
sat; so stern a neighbour was too restrictive—to him, in his present 
fractious mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any 
information, 

“Let her come to me,” I entreated; “she will, perhaps, trouble you, 
sir: there is plenty of room on this side.” 

He handed her over as if she had been a Jap-dog. “I'll send her to 
school yet,” he said, but now he was smiling. 


JANE EYRE 229 


Adéle heard him, and asked if she was to go to school “sans made- 
moiselle?” 

“Yes,” he replied, “absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take 
mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the 
white valleys among the volcano tops, and mademoiselle shall live with 
me there, and only me.” 

“She will have nothing to eat; you will starve her,” observed Adéle. 

“TI shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hill- 
sides in the moon are bleached with manna, Adéle.” 

“She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?” 

“Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her 
up Lo a peak, and Jay her down on the edge of a crater.” 

“Oh, qu’elle y sera mal—peu comfortable! And her clothes, they will 
wear out: how can she get new ones?” 

Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled. “Hem!” said he. “What 
would you do, Adéle? Cudgel your brains for an expedient. How would 
a white or a pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think? And one could 
cut a pretty enough scarf out of a rainbow.” 

“She is far better as she is,” concluded Adéle, after musing some time. 
“Besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon, If I 
were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you.” 

“She has consented—she has pledged her word.” 

“But you can’t get her there; there is no road to the moon—it is ali 
air; and neither you nor she can fly.” 

“Adéle, look at that field.” We were now outside Thornfield gates, 
and bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust 
was well laid by the thunderstorm, and where the low hedges and lofty 
timber trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed. 

“In that field, Adéle, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight 
since—the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard 
meadows; and as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me 
on a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to 
write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, ana a wish I had for 
happy days to come, I was writing away very fast, though daylight was 
fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two 
yards off me. I looked at it. It was a little thing with a veil of gossa- 
mer on its head. I beckoned it to come near me; it stood at my knee. 
T never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I read its 
eyes, and it read mine, and our speechless colloquy was to this effect :— 

“Tt was 2 fairy, and come from elf-land, it said; and its errand was to 
make me happy. I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely 
place—such as the moon, for instance—and it nodded its head towards 
her horn, rising over Hayhill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver 


098 
230 JANE EYRE 
vale where we might live. I said I should like to go; but reminded it, as 
you did me, that I had no wings to fly. 

“Oh,’ returned the fairy, ‘that does not signify! Here is a 1alisman 
will remove all difficulties;’ and she held out a pretty gold ring. ‘Put it,’ 
she said, ‘on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and you 
are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.’ 
She nodded again at the moon. The ring, Adéle, is in my breeches- 
pocket, under the disguise of a sovereign; but I mean soon to change it 
to a ring again.” 

“But what has mademoiselle to do with it? I don’t care for the fairy: 
you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?” 

“Mademoiselle is a fairy,” he said, whispering mysteriously. Where- 
upon I told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced 
a fund of genuine French scepticism, denominating Mr. Rochester “un 
vrai menteur,” and assuring him that she made no account whatever of 
his “contes de fée,” and that “du reste, il n’y avait pas de fées, et quand 
méme il y en avait:” she was sure they would never appear to him, nor 
ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon, 

The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me. Mr. 
Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was 
ordered to choose half a dozen dresses. I hated the business; I begged 
leave to defer it: no—it should be gone through with now. By dint of 
entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to 
two: these, however, he vowed he would select himself. With anxiety I 
watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the 
most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin. I told him in a 
new series of whispers that he might as well buy me a gold crown and a 
silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his 
choice. With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I per- 
suaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and 
pearl-gray silk. “It might pass for the present,” he said; “but he would 
yet see me glittering like a parterre.” 

Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a 
jeweller’s shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with 
a sense of annoyance and degradation. As we re-entered the carriage, 
and I sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of 
events dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten—the letter of my 
uncle, John Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me 
his legatee, “It would, indeed, be a relief,” I thought, “if I had ever so 
small an independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by 
Mr. Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower 
falling daily round me. I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, 
and tell my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had 


JANE EYRE 231 


but a prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of for- 
tune, I could better endure to be kept by him now.” And somewhat re- 
lieved by this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured 
once more to meet my master’s and lover’s eye, which most pertina- 
ciously sought mine, though I averted both face and gaze. He smiled: 
and J thought his smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond 
moment, bestow on a slave his gold and gems had enriched. I crushed 
his hand, which was ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to 
him red with the passionate pressure. 

“You need not look in that way,” I said; “if you do, I’ll wear nothing 
but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter. I’ll be married in 
this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of 
the pearl-gray silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black 
satin,’ 

He chuckled; he rubbed his hands. “Oh, it is rich to see and hear 
her!” he exclaimed. “Is she original? is she piquant? I would not ex- 
change this one little English girl for the Grand Turk’s whole scraglio, 
gazelle-eyes, houri forms, and all!” 

The Eastern allusion bit me again. “T’ll not stand you an inch in the 
stead of a seraglio,” I said; ‘so don’t consider me an equivalent for one. 
If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir, to 
the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave- 
purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend satisfac- 
torily here,” 

“And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons 
of flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?” 

“T'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty 
to them that are enslaved—your harem inmates amongst the rest. I'll 
get admitted there, and I’ stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw 
as you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands: 
nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have signed a 
charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred.” 

“I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane.” 

“{ would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with 
an eye like that. While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever 
charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when released, 
would be to violate its conditions.” 

“Why, Jane, what would you have? I fear you will compel me to go 
through a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the 
altar. You will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms—what will they be?” 

“T only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations. 
De you remember what you said of Céline Varens?—of the diamonds, 
the cashmeres you gave her? I will not be your English Céline Varens, 


232 JANE EYRE 


I shall continue to act as Adéle’s governess; by that I shall earn my 
board and lodging, and thirty pourds a year besides. I'l] furnish my own 
wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but———” 

“Well, but what?” 

“Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be 

uit.” 
: “Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven’t 
your equal,” said he. We were now approaching Thornfield. “Will it 
please you to dine with me to-day?” he asked, as we re-entered the 
gates. 

“No, thank you, sir.” 

“And what for ‘No, thank you’? if one may inquire.” 

“T never have dined with you, sir; and I see no reason why I should 
now, till ” 

“Til what? You delight in half phrases.” 

“Till I can’t help it,” 

"Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being 
the companion of my repast?” 

“Tt have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go 
on as usual for another month.” 

“You will give up your governessing slavery at once.” 

“Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not. I shall just go on with 
it as usual. I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been ac- 
customed to do. You may send for me in the evening, when you feel dis- 
posed to see me, and I’ll come then; but at no other time.” 

“J want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all 
this, ‘pour me donner une contenance,’ as Adéle would say; and unfor- 
tunately I have neither my cigar-case nor my snuff-box. But listen— 
whisper. It is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine presently; 
and when once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I'll just— 
figuratively speaking—attach you to a chain like this” (touching his 
watch-guard). “Yes, ‘bonny wee thing, I'll wear you in my bosom, lest 
my jewel I should tyne,’ ” 

He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage; and while 
he afterwards lifted out Adéle, I entered the house. and made good my 
retreat upstairs. 

He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening. I had prepared 
an occupation for him; for I was determincd not to spend the whole 
time in a téte-d-iéte conversation. J remembered his fine voice; I knew 
he liked to sing—good singers generally do. I was no vocalist myself, 
and, in his fastidious judgment, no musician either; but I delighted in 
listening when the performance was good. No sooner had twilight, that 
hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the 


4 


JANE EYRE 233 


lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love of 
heaven, to give me a song. He said I was a capricious witch, and that 
he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like 
the present. 

“Did I like his voice?” he asked. 

“Very much,” I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of 
his; but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e’en soothe 
and stimulate it. 

“Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment.” 

“Very well, sir, I will try.” 

I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated “a 
little bungler.” Being pushed unceremoniously to one side—which was 
precisely what I wished—he usurped my place, and proceeded to ac- 
company himself; for he could play as well as sing. I hied me to the 
window-recess. And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees 
and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following 
strain:— 

$ “The truest Jove that ever heart 
Felt at its kindled core, 
Did through each vein, in quickened start, 
The tide of being pour. 


“Her coming was my hope each day, 
Her parting was my pain; 
The chance that did her steps delay 
Was ice in every vein. 


“T dreamed it would be nameless bliss, 
As I loved, loved to be; 
And to this object did I press 
As blind as eagerly. 


“But wide as pathless was the space 
That lay our lives between, 
And dangerous as the foamy race 
Of ocean-surges green, 


“And haunted as a robber-path 
Through wilderness or wood; 
For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath, 
Between our spirits stood. 


“T dangers dared, I hindrance scorned, 
I omens did defy; 
Whatever menaced, harassed, warned 
I passed impetuous by. 


234 JANE EYRE 


“On sped my rainbow, fast as slight: 
I flew as in a dream; 
For glorious rose uvon my sight 
That child of Shower and Gleam. 


“Still bright on clouds of suffering dim 
Shines that soft, solemn joy; 
Nor care I now how dense and grim 
Disasters gather nigh, 


“T care not, in this moment sweet, 
Though all I have rushed o’er 
Should come on pinion, strong and fleet, 
Proclaiming vengeance sore; 


“Though haughty Hate should strike me down, 
Right bar approach to me, 
And grinding Might, with furious frown, 
Swear endless enmity. 


“My love has placed her little hand 
With noble faith in mine, 
And vowed that wedlock’s sacred band 
Our nature shall entwine. 


“My love has sworn with sealing kiss, 
With me to live—to die; 
I have at last my nameless bliss: 
As I love, loved am I!” 


He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his 
full fulcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament, 
T quailed momentarily—then I rallied. Soft scene, daring demonstra~ 
tion, I would not have; and T stood in peril of both: a weapon of de- 
fence must be prepared, I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I 
asked with asperity, “whom he was going to marry now?” 

“That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane.” 

“Indeed! I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had 
talked of his future wife dying with him, What did he mean by such a 
pagan idea? Z had no intention of dying with him—he might depend on 
that. 

“Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him! 
Death was not for such as I.” . 

“Tndeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my Lime came as he 
had; but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee.” 

“Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a 
reconciling kiss?” 


JANE EYRE 235 


“No; I would rather be excused.” 

Here I heard myself apostrophized as a “hard little thing;” and it was 
added, ‘‘any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing 
such stanzas crooned in her praise.” 

I assured him I was naturally hard—very flinty, and that he would 
often find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him 
divers rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks 
elapsed: he should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while 
there was yet time to rescind it. 

“Would I be quiet and talk rationally?” 

“T would be quiet if he liked; and as to talking rationally, I flattered 
myself I was doing that now.” 

He fretted, pished, and pshawed. “Very good,” I thought; “you may 
fume and fidget as you please, but this is the best plan to pursue with 
you, I am certain. I like you more than I can say; but I’ll not sink into 
a bathos of sentiment, and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you 
from the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent 
aid that distance between you and myself more conducive to our real 
mutual advantage.” 

From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then, 
after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I 
got up, and saying, “I wish you good-night, sir,’ in my natural and 
wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away. 

The system thus entered on I pursued during the whole season of 
probation, and with the best success. He was kept, to be sure, rather 
cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently enter- 
tained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility, 
while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment, 
satisfied his common sense, and even suited his taste less, 

In other people’s presence, I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet, 
any other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening 
conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him. He continued to send for 
me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when IJ ap- 
peared before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as “love” and 
“darling” on his lips: the best words at my service were “provoking 
puppet,” “malicious elf,” “sprite,” “changeling,” etc. For caresses, too, 
I now got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for 
a kiss on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear. It was all right: at pres- 
ent I decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender. 
Mrs, Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished; 
therefore I was certain I did well. Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I 
was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for 
my present conduct at some periad fast coming. I laughed in my sleeve 


236 JANE EYRE 


at his menaces. “I can keep you in reasonable check now,” I reflected; 
“and I don’t doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses 
its virtue, another must be devised.” 

Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have 
pleased than teased him, My future husband was becoming to me my 
whole world; and more than the world—almost my hope of heaven. He 
stood between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes 
between man and the broad sun. I could not, in those days, see God for 
His creature-~of whom I had made an idol. 


CHAPTER XXV 


Tue month of courtship had wasted; its very last hours were being 
numbered. There was no putting off the day that advanced—the bridal 
day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete. J, at least, had 
nothing more to do. There were my trunks, packed, locked, corded, 
ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this 
time, they would be far on their road to London, and so should I (D.V.) 
~—or tather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I 
knew not. The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four 
little squares, in the drawer. Mr. Rochester had himself written the di- 
rection, “Mrs. Rochester, ——- Hotel, London,” on each: I could not 
persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed. Mrs. Rochester! 
She did not exist--she would not be born till to-morrow, some time afler 
eight o’clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into 
the world alive before I assigned to her all that property. It was enough 
that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be 
hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bon- 
net; for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment—the pearl- 
coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped portmanteau. 
I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like apparel it contained; 
which, at this evening hour—nine o’clock-——gave out certainly a most 
ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment. “I will leave 
you by yourself, white dream,” I said. “I am feverish: I hear the wind 
blowing; I will go out of doors and feel it.” 

It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not 
only the anticipation of the great change—the new life which was to 
commence to-morrow—(both these circumstances had their share, 
doubtless, in producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me 
forth at this late hour into the darkening grounds): but a third cause 
influenced my mind more than they. 

I had at heart a strange and anxious thought. Something had hap- 


JANE EYRE 237 


pened which I could not comprehend. No one knew of or had seen the 
event but myself. It had taken place the preceding night. Mr. Roch- 
ester that night was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: busi- 
ness had called him to a small estate of two or three farms he possessed 
thirty miles off—business it was requisite he should settle in person, 
previous to his meditated departure from England. I waited now his re- 
turn; eager to disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of 
the enigma that perplexed me. Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I 
disclose my secret to him, you shall share the confidence. 

I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day 
had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a 
speck of rain. Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to aug- 
ment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way, 
never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an 
hour, so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads north- 
ward; the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following mass on mass: 
no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day. 

It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind, de- 
livering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering 
through space. Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the 
chestnut tree: it stood up black and riven; the trunk, split down the 
centre, gasped ghastly. The cloven halves were not broken from each 
other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below; 
though community of vitality was destroyed—the sap could flow no 
more: their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter’s 
tempests would be sure to fell one or both to earth. As yet, however, 
they might be said to form one tree—a ruin, but an entire ruin. ; 

“Vou did right to hold fast to each other,” I said, as if the monster 
splinters were living things and could hear me. “I think, scathed as you 
look, and charred and ‘scorched, there must be a little sense of life in 
you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots. You 
will never have green leaves more—never more see birds making nests 
and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over 
with you: but you are not desolate; each of you has a comrade to sym- 
pathize with him in his decay.” As I looked up at them, the moon ap- 
peared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure. 
Her disk was blood-red and half overcast: she seemed to throw on me 
one bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in 
the deep drift of cloud. The ‘wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; 
but far away over wood and water poured a wild, melancholy wail: it 
was sad to listen to, and I ran off again. 

Here and there I strayed through the orchard; gathered up the ap- 
ples with which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then 


238 JANE EYRE 


I employed myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe. I carried them 
into the house and put them away in the storeroom. Then I repaired to 
the library to ascertain whether the fire was lit; for, though summer, T 
knew on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheer- 
ful hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, 
and burnt well. I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner; I wheeled 
the table near it; J let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in 
ready for lighting. More restless than ever, when I had completed these 
arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a little 
timepicce in the room and the old clock in the hall simultaneously 
struck ten. 

“How late it grows!” I said. “I will run down to the gates: it is 
moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road. He may be 
coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense.” 

The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; 
but the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all 
still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at inter- 
vals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried by one 
moving speck. 

A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked—a tear of disappoint- 
ment and impatience. Ashamed of it, I wiped it away. I lingered: the 
moon shut herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her cur- 
tain of dense cloud; the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the 
gale. 

“YT wish he would come! I wish he would come!” I exclaimed, seized 
with hypochondriac foreboding. I had expected his arrival before tea; 
now it was dark: what could keep him? Had an accident happened? 
The event of last night again recurred to me. I interpreted it as a 
warning of disaster. I feared my hopes were too bright to be realized; 
and I had enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had 
passed its meridian, and must now decline. 

“Well, I cannot return to the house,” I thought; “I cannot sit by the 
fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs 
than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him,” 

I set out; I walked fast, but not far. Ere I had measured a quarter of 
a mile I heard the tramp of hoofs: a horseman came on, full gallop; a 
dog ran by his side. Away with evil presentiment! It was he: here he 
‘was, mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot. He saw me; for the moon 
had opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took 
his hat off, and waved it round his head. I now ran to meet him. 

“There!” he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from 
the saddle, “you can’t do without me, that is evident. Step on my boot- 
toe; give me both hands: mount!” 


JANE EYRE 239 


I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him. A hearty kiss- 
ing I got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed 
as well as I could. He checked himself in his exultation to demand, 
“But is there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at 
such an hour? Is there anything wrong?” 

“No; but I thought you would never come. I could not bear to wait 
in the house for you, especially with this rain and wind.” 

“Rain and wind, indeed! Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; puli 
my cloak round you. But I think you are feverish, Jane—~both your 
cheek and hand are burning hot. I ask again, is there anything the 
matter?” 

“Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy.” 

“Then you have been both?” 

“Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-by, sir; and I dare say’ 
you will only laugh at me for my pains.” 

“Y'l1 laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare 
not: my prize is not certain, This is you who have been as slippery as 
an eel this last month and as thorny as a brier-rose! I could not lay a 
finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up 
a stray lamb in my arms. You wandered out of the fold to seek your 
shepherd, did you, Jane?” 

“T wanted you; but don’t boast, Here we are at Thornfield: now let 
me get down.” 

He landed me on the pavement. As John took his horse, and he fol- 
lowed me into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry 
on, and then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made 
for the staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long. Nor was. 
I long; in five minutes I rejoined him. I found him at supper, 

“Take a seat and bear me company, Jane. Please God, it is the last 
meal but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time.” 

I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat. 

“Ts it because you have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane? 
Is it the thought of going to London that takes away your appetite?” 

“T cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know 
what thoughts I have in my head. Everything in life seems unreal.” 

“Except me: I am substantial enough~—touch me.” 

“You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all; you are a mere dream.” 

He held out his hand, laughing. “Is that a dream?” said he, placing 
it close to my eyes. He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as « 
well as a long, strong arm. 

“Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream,” said I, as I put it down from 
hefore my face, “Sir, have you finished supper?” 

“Ves, Jane,” 


240 JANE EYRE 


I rang the bell and ordered away the tray. When we were again alone, 
I stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master’s knee. 

“Tt ig near midnight,” I said. 

“Yes; but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night 
before my wedding.” 

“J did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I 
have no wish to go to bed.” 

“Are all your arrangements complete?” 

“All, sir.” 

“And on my part likewise,” he returned, “I have settled everything; 
and we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half an hour after our 
return from church.” 

“Very well, sir.” 

“With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word ‘very well,’ 
Jane! What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how 
strangely your eyes glitter! Are you well?” 

“T believe I am.” 

“Believe! What is the matter? Tefl me what you fecl.” 

“T could not, sir; no words could tell you what J feel. I wish this 
present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may 
come charged?” 

“This is hypochondria, Jane. You have been over-excited, or over- 
fatigued.” 

“Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?” 

“Calm?—no: but happy—to the heart’s core.” 

I looked wp at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent 
and flushed. 

“Give me your confidence, Jane,” he said: “relieve your mind of any 
weight that oppresses il, by imparting it to me. What do you fear?— 
that I shall not prove a good husband?” 

“Tt is the idea farthest from my thoughts,” 

“Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter—of 
the new life into which you are passing?” 

No.” 

“You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity per- 
plex and pain me. I want an explanation.” 

“Then, sir, listen. You were from home last night?” 

“T was—I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which 
bad happened in my absence:—nothing, probably, of consecjence; but, 
in short, it has disturbed you. Let me hear it. Mrs. Fairfax has said 
something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?—your 
sensitive self-respect has been wounded?” 

“No, sir.” It struck twelve: I waited till the timepiece had concluded 


JANE EYRE 241 


its silver chime and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I 
proceeded :— 

“All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless 
bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting 
fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to have 
the hope of living with you, because I Jove you. No, sir, don’t caress me 
now—let me talk undisturbed. Yesterday I trusted well in Providence, 
and believed that events were working together for your good and 
mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect—the calmness of the air and sky 
forbade ayiprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your 
journey, I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of 
you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your 
actual presence. I thought of the life that lay before me—your life, sir 
—an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more 
so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows 

} of its own strait channel, I wondered why moralists call this world a 
‘} dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like @ rose. Just at sunset the 
, air turned cold and the sky cloudy. I went in. Sophie called me up- 
' stairs to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and 
under it in the box I found your present—the veil which, in your prince- 
ly extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since 
I would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly. 
I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your 
aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in the 
attributes of a peeress. I thought how I would carry down to you the 
square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for 
my low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman 
who could bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections. 
TI saw plainly how you would look, and heard your impetuous republican 
answers, and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to 
augment your wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a 
purse or a coronet.” 

“How well you read me, you witch!” interposed Mr. Rochester: “but 
what did you find in the veil besides its embroidery? Did you find 
poison, or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?” 

“No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found 
nothing save Fairfax Rochester’s pride: and that did not scare me, be- 
cause I am used to the sight of the demon. But, sir, as it grew dark, the 
wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now—wild and 
high—but ‘with a sullen, moaning sound’ far more eerie. I wished you 
were at home. I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair 
and fireless hearth chilled me. For some time after I went to bed I could 
not sleep—a sense of anxious excitement distressed me, The gale still 


242 JANE EYRE 


rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether in 
the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred, doubtful yet 
doleful, at every lull. At last I made out it must be some dog howling at 
a distance. J was glad when it ceased. On sleeping, I continued in 
dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night. I continued also the wish to 
be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful consciousness of some 
barrier dividing us. During all my first sleep I was following the wind- 
ings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed me; rain pelted me; 
I was burdened with the charge of a little child—a very small creature, 
too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in my cold arms and 
wailed piteously in my ear. I thought, sir, that you were on the road a 
long way before me; and I strained every nerve to overtake you, and 
made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat you Lo stop: but my 
movements were feltered, and my voice still died away inarticulate; 
while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every moment.” 

“And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close 
to you? Little nervous subject! forget visionary woe, and think only of 
real happiness! You say you love me, Janet: yes—I will not forget 
that; and you cannot deny it. Those words did not dic inarticulate on 
your lips. I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn, perhaps, 
but sweet as music—'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of 
living with you, Edward, because I love you.’ Do you love me, Jane— 
repeat it.” 

“T do, sir—TI do, with my whole heart.” 

“Well,” he said, after some minutes’ silence, “it is strange; but that 
sentence has penetrated my breast painfully, Why? I think because you 
said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your up- 
ward gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: 
it is too much as if some spirit were near me. Look wicked, Jane—as 
you know well how to look; coin one of your wild, shy, provoking 
smiles; tell me you hate me—tease me, vex me; do anything but move 
me: I would rather be incensed than saddened.” 

“J will tease you and vex you to your heart’s content when I have 
finished my tale; but hear me to the end.” 

“T thought, Jane, you had told me all. I thought I had found the 
source of your melancholy in a dream.” 

I shook my head. “What! is there more? But I will not believe it to 
be anything important. I warn you of incredulity beforehand. Go on.” 

The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of 
his manner, surprised me; but I proceeded. 

“J dreamt another dream, sir: that Thomfield Hall was a dreary ruin, 
the retreat of bats and owls. I thought that of all the stately frone 
nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very bigh and very fragile. 


JANE EYRE 243 


looking I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-grown en- 
closure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there over a 
fallen fragment of cornice. Wrapped up in a shawl, I still carried the 
unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere—however tired 
were my arms, however much its weight impeded my progress, I must 
retain it. I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the road: I was 
sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and for a dis- 
tant country. I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous haste, eager 
to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled from under 
my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung round my 
neck in terror and almost strangled me. At last I gained the summit. I 
saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment. The 
blast blew so strong I could not stand. I sat down on the narrow ledge; 
I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the road; 
T bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was shaken; the 
child rolled from my knee; I lost my balance, fell, and woke,” 

“Now, Jane, that is all.” 

“All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come. On waking, a gleam 
dazzled my eyes. I thought—Oh, it is daylight! But I was mistaken; it 
was only candlelight, Sophie, I supposed, had come in, There was a 
light on the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before go- 
ing to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open. I heard a 
rustling there. I asked, ‘Sophie, what are you doing?’ No one answered; 
but a form emerged from the closet. It took the light, held it aloft, and 
surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau. ‘Sophie! 
Sophie!’ Y again cried; and still it was silent. I had risen up in bed; I 
bent forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and 
then my blood crept cold through my veins. Mr. Rochester, this was not 
Sophie; it was not Leah; it was not Mrs. Fairfax; it was not—no, I was 
sure of it, and am still—it was not even that strange woman, Grace 
Poole.” 

“Tt must have been one of them,” interrupted my master. 

“No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary. The shape standing 
before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield 
Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me.” ' 

“Describe it, Jane.” ‘a 

“Tt seemed, sir, a woman tall and large, with thick and dark hair 
hanging long down her back. I know not what dress she had on; it was 
white and straight, but whether gown, sheet, or shroud I cannot tell.” 

“Did you see her face?” 

“Not at first. But presently she took my veil from its place; she held 
it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head and 


244 JANE EYRE 


turned to the mirror. At that moment J saw the reflection of the visage 
and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass.” 

“And how were they?” 

“Fearful and ghastly to me—oh, sir, I never saw a face like it! It was 
a discoloured face—it was a savage face. I wish I could forget the roll 
of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!” 

“Ghosts are usually pale, Jane.” 

“This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow fur- 
rowed; the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes, Shall 
I tell you of what it reminded me?” 

“Vou may.” 

“Of the foul German spectre, the Vampyre.” 

“Ah!—what did it dap” 

“Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and 
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them.” 

“Afterwards?” 

“Tt drew aside the window-curtain and looked out: perhaps it saw 
dawn. approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door. Just 
at my bedside the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me; she 
thrust up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my 
eyes. I was aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost con- 
sciousness: for the second time in my life—only the second time—~I 
became insensible from terror.” 

“Who was with you when you revived?” 

“No one, sir, but the broad day. I rose, bathed my head and face in 
water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill, 
and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision. Now, 
sir, tell me who and what that woman was?” 

“The creature of an over-stimulated brain—that is cerlain. I must 
be carcful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for 
rough handling.” 

“Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault: the thing was real: 
the transaction actually took place.” 

“And your previous dreams, were they real too? Is Thornfield Hall 
a ruin? Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles? Am I leav- 
ing you without a tear—without a kiss—without a word?” 

“Not yet.” 

“Am I about to do it? Why, the day is already commenced which is 
to bind us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be ne 
recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that.” 

“Mental terrors, sir! I wish I could believe them to be only such: I 
wish it more now than ever, since even you cannot explain to me the 
mystery of that awful visitant.” 


JANE EYRE 245 


“And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal.” 

“But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when 
I looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheer- 
ful aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there—on the carpet 
—I saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis—the veil, torn 
from top to bottom in two halves!” 

I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms 
round me. “Thank God!” he exclaimed, “that if anything malignant did 
come near you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed. Oh, to 
think what might have happened!” 

He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him I could 
scarcely pant. After some minutes’ silence, he continued cheerily,— 

“Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it. It was half dream, half 
reality. A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room; and that woman 
was—must have been—Grace Poole. You call her a strange being your- 
self: from all you know, you have reason so to call her. What did she 
do to me? what to Mason? In a state between sleeping and waking, 
you noticed her entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious 
as you were, you ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her 
own, The long dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated 
stature, were figments of imagination, results of nightmare; the spiteful 
tearing of the veil was real—and it is like her. I sce you would ask why 
I keep such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year 
and a day, I will tell you; but not now. Are you satisfied, Jane? Do you 
accept my solution of the mystery?” 

I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one: sat- 
isfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear so—relieved, 
I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented smile. And now, 
as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him. 

“Does not Sophie sleep with Adéle in the nursery?” he asked, as I lit 
my candle. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“And there is room enough in Adéle’s little bed for you. You must 
share it with her to-night, Jane. It is no wonder that the incident you 
have related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not 
sleep alone: promise me to go to the nursery.” 

*T shall be very glad to do so, sir.” 

“And fasten the door securely on the inside. Wake Sophie when you 
go upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time 
to-morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before 
eight, And now, no more sombre thoughts; chase dull care away, Janet. 
Don’t you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is 


246 JANE EYRE 


no more beating of rain against the window-panes: Jook here” (he lifted 
up the curtain) —‘St is a lovely night!” 

Tt was. Half heaven was pure and stainless. The clouds, now troop” 
ing before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off east- 
ward in long, silvered columns, The moon shone peacefully. 

“Well,” said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, “how is 
my Janet now?” 

“The night is serene, sir; and so am I.” 

“And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night, but of 
happy love and blissful union.” 

This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sor- 
row, but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all. With little 
Adéle in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood—so tranquil, so 
passionless, so innocent—and waited for the coming day. All my life 
was awake and astir in my frame; and as soon as the sun rose J rose 
too, I remember Adéle clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed 
her as I loosened her little hands from my neck, and I cried over her 
with strange emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would 
break her still sound repose. She seemed the emblem of my past life; 
and he I was now to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, types 
of my unknown future day, 


CHAPTER XXVI 


SopHte came at seven to dress me. She was very long indeed in ac- 
complishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose, im- 
patient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come. She was just 
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with 
a brooch, I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could, 

“Stop!” she cried in French, “Look at yourself in the mirror; you 
have not taken one peep,” 

So I turned at the door. I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my 
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger. “Janel” called 
a voice, and I hastened down. I was received at the foot of the stairs by 
Mr. Rochester. 

“Lingerer|” he said, “my brain is on fire with impatience, and you 
tarry so long!” 

He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pro- 
nounced me “fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the 
desize of his eyes,” and then telling me he would give me but ten min- 
utes to eat some breakfast, he rang the bell. One of his lately hired ser- 
vants, a footman, answered it. 


JANE EYRE 247 


“Ts John getting the carriage ready?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Ts the luggage brought down?” 

“They are bringing it down, sir.” 

“Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the 
clerk are there: return and tell me.” 

The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates. The 
footman soon returned. 

“Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice.” 

“And the carriage?” 

“The horses are harnessing.” 

“We shall not want it to go to church, but it must be ready the mo- 
ment we return—all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, 
and the coachman in his seat.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Jane, are you ready?” 

I rose. There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no xelatives to 
wait for or marshal—none but Mr. Rochester and me. Mrs, Fairfax 
stood in the hall as we passed. I would fain have spoken to her, but 
my hand was held by a grasp of iron—I was hurried along by a stride 
I could hardly follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester’s face was to feel 
that not a second of delay would be tolerated for any purpose. I wonder 
what other bridegroom ever looked as he did—so bent up to a purpose, 
so grimly resolute; or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed 
such flaming and flashing eyes. 

T knew not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, 
I gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes, and both 
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester’s frame. I wanted to see the in- 
visible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a glance 
fierce and fell. I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he seemed 
breasting and resisting. 

At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out 
of breath, “Am I cruel in my love?” he said. “Delay an instant: lean 
on me, Jane.” 

And now I can recall the picture of the gray old house of God rising 
calm before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morn- 
ing sky beyond. I remember something, too, of the green grave- 
mounds; and I have not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers stray- 
ing amongst the low hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the 
few mossy headstones. I noticed them, because, as they saw us, they 
passed round to the back of the church, and I doubted not they were 
going to enter by the side-aisle door and witness the ceremony. By Mr. 
Rochester they were not observed: he was earnestly looking at my face, 


248 JANE EYRE 


from which the blood had, I dare say, momentarily fled; for I felt my 
forehead dewy and my cheeks and lips cold. When I rallied, which I 
scon did, he walked gently with me up the path to the porch. 

We entered the quiet and humble temple: the priest waited in his 
white surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him, All was still: two 
shadows only moved in a remote corner. My conjecture had been cor- 
rect: the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the 
vault of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the 
tails the old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded 
the remains of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time 
of the civil wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife. 

Our place was taken at the communion rails. Hearing a cautious step 
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers—a gentle- 
man, evidently—was advancing up the chancel. The service began. The 
explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the 
clergyman came a step farther forward, and, bending slightly towards 
Mr, Rochester, went on:— 

“T require and charge you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful day 
of judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, that if 
either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined 
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it. For be ye well assured, 
thal so many as are coupled together otherwise than God’s Word doth 
allow, are not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony law- 
ful.” 

He paused, as the custom is. When is the pause after that sentence 
ever broken by reply? Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years. And the 
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his 
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already 
stretched towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, “Wilt thou 
have this woman for they wedded wife?”——-when a distinct and near 
voice said ,— 

“The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impedi- 
ment.” 

The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk 
did the same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an carthquake had 
rolled under his feet. Taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head 
or eyes, he said, “Proceed.” 

Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word with deep but 
low intonation. Presently Mr. Wood said,— 

“J cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been as+ 
serted, and evidence of its truth or falsehood.” 

“The ceremony is quite broken off,” subjoined the voice behind us. 


JANE EYRE 249 


“T am in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment 
to this marriage exists.” 

Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not. He stood stubborn and rigid, 
making no movement but to possess himself of my hand. What a hot 
and strong grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, 
firm, massive front at this moment! How his eye shone, still watch- 
ful, and yet wild beneath! 

Mr. Wood seemed at a loss. “What is the nature of the impediment?” 
he asked. “Perhaps it may be got over—explained away?” 

“Hardly,” was the answer. “I have called it insuperable, and I speak 
advisedly.” 

The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails. He continued, 
uttering each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly — 

“Tt simply consists in the existence of w previous marriage. Mr. 
Rochester has a wife now living.” 

My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never 
vibrated to thunder; my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never 
felt frost or fire: but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning. I 
looked at Mr. Rochester; I made him look at me. His whole face was 
colourless rock; his eye was both spark and flint. He disavowed noth- 
ing; he seemed as if he would defy all things. Without speaking, with- 
out smiling, without seeming to recognize in me a human being, he only 
twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side. ¢ 

“Who are you?” he asked of the intruder. 

“My name is Briggs, a solicitor of Street, London.” 

“And you would thrust on me a wife?” 

“T would remind you of your lady’s existence, sir, which the law rec- 
ognizes, if you do not.” 

“Favour me with an account of her—with her name, her parentage, 
her place of abode.” 

“Certainly.” Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and 
read out in a sort of official, nasal voice:— 

*‘T affirm and can prove that on the 20th ot October AD. —— 
(a date of fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thorn- 
field Hall, in the county of , and of Ferndean Manor, in shire, 
England, was married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter 
of Jonas Mason, merchant, and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at 
Church, Spanish Town, Jamaica, The record of the marriage will 
be found in the register of that church: a copy of it is now in my 
possession, Signed, Richard Mason,’ ” 

“That—if a genuine document—may prove I have been married, but 
it does not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still 
living.” 


250 JANE EVRE 


“She was living three months ago,” returned the lawyer. 

“How do you know?” 

“T have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will 
scarcely controvert.” 

“Produce him—or go to hell.” 

“{ will produce him first—he is on the spot. Mr, Mason, have the 
goodness to step forward.” 

Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth, He experienced, 
too, 2 sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the 
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame. The 
second stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew 
near: a pale face looked over the solicitor’s shoulder—yes, it was Mason 
himself. Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him. His eye, as I have 
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in 
its gleam; and his face flushed—olive cheek and hueless forehead re- 
ceived a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred, 
lifted his strong arm—he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the 
church floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body—but 
Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, “Good God!” Contempt fell 
cool on Mr. Rochester—his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it 
up; he only asked, “What have you to say?” 

An inaudible reply escaped Mason’s white lips. 

“The devil is in it Jf you cannot answer distinctly. I again demand, 
what have you to say?” 

“Sir—sir,” interrupted the clergyman, “do not forget you are in a 
sacred place.” Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, “Are you 
aware, sir, whether or nct this gentleman’s wife is still living?” 

“Courage,” urged the lawyer,—"“speak out.” 

“She is now living at Thornfield Hall,” said Mason, in more articulate 
tones, “I saw her there last April. I am her brother,” 

“At Thornfield Hall!” ejaculated the clergyman, “Impossible! I am 
an old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs. 
Rochester at Thornfield Hall.” 

I saw a grim smile contort Mr, Rochester’s lips, and he muttered,— 

“No, by God! I took care that none should hear of it—or of her 
under that name.” He mused—for ten minutes he held counsel with 
himself: he formed his resolve, and announced it,— 

“Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel. 
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the 
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day.” The man 
obeyed. 

Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: “Bigamy is an ugly 
word! I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manouvred 


JANE EYRE 251 


me, or Providence has checked me-—-perhaps the last. I am little better 
than a devil at this moment, and, as my pastor there would tell me, 
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless 
fire and deathless worm. Gentlemen, my plan is broken up. What this 
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman 
to whom I was married lives! You say you never heard of a Mrs. 
Rochester at the house up yonder, Wood; but I dare say you have many 
a time inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept 
there under watch and ward. Some have whispered to you that she is 
my bastard half-sister; some, my cast-off mistress. I now inform you 
that she is my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago—Bertha Mason 
by name, sister of this resolute personage, who is now, with his quiver- 
ing limbs and white cheeks, showing you what a stout heart men may 
bear.—Cheer up, Dick!~-never fear me! I’d almost as soon strike a 
‘woman as you.—Bertha Mason is mad; and she came of a mad family— 
idiots and maniacs through three generations! Her mother, the Creole, 
was both a madwoman and a drunkard!—as I found out after I had wed 
the daughter; for they were silent on family secrets before. Bertha, like 
a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points. I had a charming part- 
ner—pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy man. I went 
through rich scenes! Oh! my experience has been heavenly, if you only 
knew it! But I owe you no further explanation. Briggs, Wood, Mason, 
I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs. Poole’s patient, 
and my wife You shall see what sort of a being I was cheated into 
espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break the compact, 
and seek sympathy with something at least human. This girl,” he con- 
tinued, looking at me, “knew no more than you, Wood, of the disgust- 
ing secret: she thought all was fair and legal, and never dreamt she was 
going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded wretch, al- 
ready bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner! Come all of you— 
follow!” 

Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came 
after. At the front door of the hall we found the carriage. 

“Take it back to the coach-house, John,” said Mr. Rochester coolly; 
“St will not be wanted to-day.” 

At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adéle, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet 
and greet us. 

“To the right-about—every soul!” cried the master; “away with your 
congratulations! Who wants them? Not I!—they are fifteen years too 
late!” 

He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and 
still beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did. We 
mounted the first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third

story: the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester’s master-key, ad- 
mitted us to the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial 
cabinet, 

“You know this place, Mason,” said our guide; “she bit and stabbed 
you here.” 

He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: 
this, too, he opened. In a room without a window there burnt a fire 
guarded by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the 
ceiling by a chain, Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking 
something in a saucepan. In the deep shade, at the farther end of the 
room, a figure ran backwards and forwards. What it was, whether beast 
or human being, one could not, at first sight, tell. It grovelled, seem- 
ingly, on all-fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild ani- 
mal: but it was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled 
hair, wild as a mane, hid its head and face. 

“Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!” said Mr. Rochester. ‘How are you? 
and how is your charge to-day?” 

“We're tolerable, sir, I thank you,” replied Grace, lifting the boiling 
mess carefully on to the hob: “rather snappish, but not ’rageous,” 

A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the 
clothed hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind feet. 

“Ah! sir, she sees you!” exclaimed Grace; “you'd better not stay.” 

“Only a few moments, Grace—you must allow me a few moments,” 

“Take care then, sir!—for God’s sake, take care!” 

The maniac bellowed; she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, 
and gazed wildly at her visitors. I recognized well that purple face, 
those bloated features, Mrs. Poole advanced. 

“Keep out of the way,” said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: “she 
has no knife now, I suppose, and I’m on my guard.” 

“One never knows what she has, sir; she is so cunning: it is not in 
mortal discretion to fathom her craft.” 

“We had better leave her,” whispered Mason. 

“Go to the devil!” was his brother-in-law’s recommendation. 

“Ware!” cried Grace. The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously. 
Mr, Rochester flung me behind him. The lunatic sprang and grappled 
his throat viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled. She 
was a big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpu- 
lent besides: she showed virile force in the contest—more than once she 
almost throttled him, athletic as he was. He could have settled her with 
a well-planted blow; but he would not strike—he would only wrestle. 
At last he mastered her arms. Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he 
pinioned them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound 
her to a chair. The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells 


JANE EYRE ‘253 


and the most convulsive plunges, Mr. Rochester then turned to the 
spectators: he looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate. 

“That is #y wife,” said he. “Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am 
ever to know—such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure 
hours! And ¢his is what I wished to have” (laying his hand on my 
shoulder): “this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth 
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon. I wanted her 
just as a change after that fierce ragout. Wood and Briggs, look at the 
difference! Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder—this 
face with that mask—this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of 
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye 
judge ye shall be judged! Off with you now. I must shut up my prize.” 

We all withdrew. Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give 
some further order to Grace Poole. The solicitor addressed me as he 
descended the stair. 

“You, madam,” said he, “are cleared from all blame. Your uncle will 
be glad to hear it-—if, indeed, he should be still living—when Mr. Mason 
returns to Madeira.” 

“My uncle! What of him? Do you know him?” 

“Mr. Mason does. Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of 
his house for some years. When your uncle received your letter in- 
timating the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, 
Mr. Mason, who was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his 
way back to Jamaica, happened to be with him. Mr. Eyre mentioned 
the intelligence; for he knew that my client here was acquainted with a 
gentleman of the name of Rochester. Mr. Mason, astonished and dis- 
tressed, as you may suppose, revealed the real state of matters. Your 
uncle, I am sorry to say, is now on a sick-bed; from which, considering 
the nature of his disease—decline—and the stage it has reached, it is 
unlikely he will ever rise. He could not then hasten to England himself, 
to extricate you from the snare into which you had fallen; but he im~- 
plored Mr. Mason to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false 
marriage. He referred him to me for assistance. I used all dispatch, 
and am thankful I was not too late—as you, doubtless, must be also. 
Were I not morally certain that your uncle will be dead ere you reach 
Madeira, I would advise you to accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it 
is, I think you had better remain in England till you can hear further, 
either from or of Mr. Eyre. Have we anything else to stay for?” he 
inquired of Mr. Mason. 

“No, no—let us be gone,” was the anxious reply; and without wait- 
ing to take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall 
door. The clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of ad- 


254 JANE EYRE 


monition or reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he 
too departed. 

I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to 
which I had now withdrawn. The house cleared, I shut myself in, fast- 
ened the bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded—not to weep, not 
to mourn, I was yet too calm for that, but-——mechanically to take off the 
wedding-dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, 
as I thought, for the last time. I then sat down: I felt weak and tired. 
I Jeaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them. And now 
I thought. Till now I had only heard, seen, moved—followed up and 
down where I was led or dragged—watched event rush on event, dis- 
closure open beyond disclosure: but now Z thought. 

The morning had been a quiet morning enough—all except the brief 
scene with the lunatic. The transaction in the church had not been 
noisy; there was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dis- 
pute, no defiance or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been 
spoken, a calmly pronounced objection to the marriage made; some 
stern, short questions put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations 
given, evidence adduced; an open admission of the truth had been ut- 
tered by my master; then the living proof had been seen; the intruders 
were gone, and all was over. 

I was in my own room as usual—just myself, without obvious change. 
Nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me. And yet where 
was the Jane Eyre of yesterday?—where was her life?-—where were her 
prospects? 

Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman-~-almost a 
bride, was a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects 
were desolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white De- 
cember storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts 
crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud; 
lanes which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with 
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy 
and fragrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and 
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway. My hopes were all dead— 
struck with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first- 
born in the land of Egypt. I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday 
so blooming and glowing: they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could 
never revive, I looked at my love—that feeling which was my master’s, 
which he had created: it shivered in my heart, like a suffering child in a 
cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not seek Mr. 
Rochester’s arms—it could not derive warmth from his breast. Oh, 
never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted—confidence de- 
stroyed! Myr. Rochester was not to me what he had been, for he was not 


JANE EYRE 255 


what I had thought him. I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not 
say he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone 
from his idea, and from his presence I must go: that I perceived well. 
When—how—whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubt- 
ed not, would hurry me from Thornfield. Real affection, it seemed, he 
could not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was 
balked; he would want me no more, I should fear even to cross his 
path now; my view must be hateful to him. Oh, how blind had been 
my eyes! how weak my conduct! 

My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim 
round me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow. Self- 
abandoned, relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in 
the dried-up bed of a great river: I heard a flood loosened in remote 
mountains, and felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had 
no strength. I lay faint, longing to be dead. One idea only still throbbed 
life-like within me—-a remembrance of God. It begot an unuttered 
prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, 
as something that should be whispered, but no energy was found to ex: 
press them,— 

“Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help.” 

It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it— 
as I had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my 
lips—~it came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me. The 
whole consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, 
my faith death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen 
mass. That bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, “the waters came 
into my soul; I sank in deep mire; I felt no standing; I came into deep 
waters; the floods overflowed me.” 


CHAPTER XXVII 


Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and 
seeing the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I 
asked, “What am I to do?” 

But the answer my mind gave—‘Leave Thornfield at once”—was so 
prompt, so dread, that I stopped my ears. I said I could not bear such 
words now. “That I am not Edward Rochester’s bride is the least part 
of my woe,” IJ alleged; “that I have wakened out of most glorious 
dreams, and found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and 
master; but that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is in- 
tolerable. I cannot do it.” 

But then a voice within me averred that I could do it, and foretold 


256 JANE EYRE 


that I should do it. I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be 
weak that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw 
laid out for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the 
throat, told her tauntingly she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the 
slough, and swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down 
to unsounded depths of agony. 

“Let me be torn away then!” I cried. “Let another help me!” 

“No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you; you shall 
yourself pluck out your right eye, yourself cut off your right hand; 
your heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it.” 

I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a 
judge haunted—at the silence which so awful a voice filled. My head 
swam as I stood erect. I perceived that I was sickening from excite- 
ment and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, 
for I had taken no breakfast. And, with a strange pang, I now re- 
flected that, long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent 
to ask how I was, or to invite me to come down—not even little Adéle 
had tapped at the door, not even Mrs. Iairfax had sought me. “Friends 
always forget. those whom fortune forsakes,” I murmured, as I undrew 
the bolt and passed out. I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still 
dizzy, my sight was dim, and my limbs were feeble. I could not soon 
recover myself. I fell, but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm 
caught me. I looked up—I was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in 
a chair across my chamber threshold. 

“You come out at last,” he said. “Well, I have been waiting for you 
long, and listening; yet nat one movement have I heard, nor one sob: 
five minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the 
lock like a burglar. So you shun me?—you shut yourself up and grieve 
alone? I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehem- 
ence. You are passionate: I expected a scene of some kind. I was pre- 
pared for the hot rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my 
breast: now, a, senseless floor has received them, or your drenched hand- 
kerchief, But I err: you have not wept at all! I see a white cheek and a 
faded eye, but no trace of tears, I suppose, then, your heart has been 
weeping blood? 

“Well, Jane! not a word of reproach? Nothing bitter—nothing poig- 
nant? Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion? You sit quietly 
where I have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look. 

“Jane, I never meant to wound you thus, If the man who had but one 
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread 
and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake slaught- 
ered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody Blondes more 
than I now rue mine. Will you ever forgive me?” 


JANE EYRE 257 


Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot. There was such 
deep remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy 
in his manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole 
look and mien—I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; 
only at my heart’s core. 

“You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?” ere long he inquired wistfully—~ 
wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness, the result 
tather of weakness than of will. 

“Ves, sir.” 

“Then tell me so roundly and sharply—-don’t spare me.” 

“I cannot; I am tired and sick. I want some water.” He heaved a 
sort of shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me down- 
stairs, At first 1 did not know to what room he had borne me; all was 
cloudy to my glazed sight. Presently I felt the reviving warmth of a 
fire; for, summer as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber. He 
put wine to my lips; I tasted it and revived. Then I ate something he 
offered me, and was soon myself, I was in the library—sitting in his 
chair—he was quite near. “If I could go out of life now, without too 
sharp a pang, it would be well for me,” I thought; “then I should not 
have to make the effort of cracking my heart-strings in rending them 
from among Mr. Rochester’s. I must leave him, it appears. I do not 
want to leave him—I cannot leave him.” 

“How are you now, Jane?” 

“Much better, sir; I shall be well soon,” 

“Taste the wine again, Jane.” 

I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, 
and looked at me attentively. Suddenly he turned away, with an inar- 
ticulate exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked 
fast through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to 
kiss me: but I remembered caresses were now forbidden. I turned my 
face away and put his aside. 

“What !—how is this?” he exclaimed hastily. “Oh, I know! you won't 
kiss the husband of Bertha Mason? You consider my arms filled and 
my embraces appropriated?” 

“At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir.” 

“Why, Jane? I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will an- 
swer for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply. I guess 
rightly?” 

“Ves.” 

“If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must 
regard me as a plotting profligate—a base and low rake who has been 
simulating disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliber- 
ately laid, and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect. What do 


258 JANE EYRE 


you say to that? I see you can say nothing. In the first place, you are 
faint still, and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second 
place, you cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and be- 
sides, the flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you 
spoke much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make 
a scene: you are thinking how to act—talking you consider is of no use. 
I know you—I am on my guard.” 

“Sir, I do not wish to act against you,” I said; and my unsteady voice 
warned me to curtail my sentence. 

“Not in your sense of the word, but iri mine you are scheming to de- 
stroy me. Vou have as good as said that, I am a married man: as a mar- 
ried man you will shun me, keep out of my way; just now you have te- 
fused to kiss me. You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to 
me—to live under this roof only as Adtle’s governess; if ever I say a 
friendly word to you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, 
you will say, ‘That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice 
and rock to him;’ and ice and rock you will accordingly become.” 

I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: “All is changed about me, 
sir; I must change too——there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctua- 
tions of fecling, and continual combats with recollections and associa- 
tions, there is only one way—Adeéle must have a new governess, sir.” 

“Oh, Adéle will go to school—I have settled that already; nor do I 
mean to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of 
Thornfield Hall—this accursed place—this tent of Achan—this insolent 
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open sky 
—this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion of 
‘such as we imagine. Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I. I was 
wrong evet to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was 
haunted. I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, 
all knewledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Addle 
never would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she 
was housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac 
elsewhere—though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more 
retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely 
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in 
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement. 
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge; but 
to each villain his own vice, and mine is not a tendency to indirect as- 
sassination, even of what I most hate. 

“Concealing the madwoman’s neighbourhood from you, however, was 
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a 
upas-tree: that demon’s vicinage is poisoned, and always was. Bul Til 
shut up Thornfield Hall; ’'ll nail up the front door and board the lower 


JANE EYRE 259 


windows, I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with my 
wife, as you term that fearful hag. Grace will do much for money; and 
she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her com- 
pany and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when my wife is 
prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to stab 
them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on———~” 

“Sir,” I interrupted him, “you are inexorable for that unfortunate 
lady: you speak of her with hate—-with vindictive antipathy. It is cruel 
-—she cannot help being mad.” 

“Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don’t 
know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again. It is not be- 
cause she is mad I hate her. If you were mad, do you think I should 
hate your” 

“T do indeed, sir,” 

“Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and noth- 
ing about the sort of love of which I am capable. Every atcim of your 
flesh is as dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be 
dear. Your mind is my treasure, and if it were broken it would be my 
treasure still; if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait 
waistcoat—your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me; if you 
flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive 
you in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive. I should 
not shrink from you with disgust as I did from her; in your quiet mom- 
ents you should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang 
over you with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in re- 
turn, and never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no 
Jonger a ray of recognition for me—But why do'I follow that train of 
ideas? I was talking of removing you from Thornfield. All, you know, 
is prepared for prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go. I only ask 
you to endure one more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell 
to its miseries and terrors for ever! I have a place to repair to, which 
will be a secure sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome 
intrusion—even from falsehood and slander.” 

“And take Adéle with you, sir,” J interrupted; “she will be a com- 
panion for you,” 

“What do you mean, Jane? I told you I would send Adéle to school; 
and what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child 
—a French dancer’s bastard? Why do you importune me about her? I 
say, why do you assign Adéle to me for a companion?” 

“Vou spoke of # retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull 
-—toa dull for you.” 

“Solitude! solitude!” he reiterated with irritation. “I see I must come 
to an explanation, I don’t know what sphinx-like expression is forming 


260 JANE EYRE 


in your countenance, You are to share my solitude. Do you under- 
stand?” 

I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was 
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent. He had been walking 
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot. 
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them 
on the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect. 

“Now for the hitch in Jane’s character,” he said at last, speaking more 
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak, “The reel of silk 
has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a 
knot and a puzzle: here it is. Now for vexation, and exasperation, and 
endless trouble. By God! I Jong to exert a fraction of Samson’s strength, 
and break the entanglement like tow!” 

He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just 
before me. 

“Jane! will you hear reason?” (he stooped and approached his lips to 
my ear); “because, if you won’t, I'll try violence.” His voice was 
hoarse; his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable 
bond and plunge headlong into wild license, I saw that in an another 
moment, and with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able Lo do 
nothing with him. The present—the passing second of time—was all I 
had in which to control and restrain him: a movement of repulsion, 
flight, fear would have sealed my doom—and his. But I was not afraid: 
not in the least. I felt an inward power—-a sense of influence, which 
supported me, The crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such 
as the Indian, perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe. 
T took hold of his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said 
to him soothingly — 

“Sit down; Tl talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have 
to say, whether reasonabic or unreasonable.”’ 

He sat down; but he did not get leave to speak directly, I had been 
struggling with tears for some time; I had taken great pains to repress 
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep. Now, however, 
I considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked, 
Ii the flood annoyed him, so much the better. So I gave way and cried 
heartily. 

Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed, I said I 
could not while he was in such a passion. 

“But I am not angry, Jane. I only love you too well; and you had 
steeled your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not 
endure it. Hush, now, and wipe your eyes.” 

His softened voice announced that he was subdued: so I, in my turn, 


i ‘ 


JANE EYRE 261 


became calm. Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, 
but I would not permit it. Then he would draw me to him:—no! 

“Jane! Jane!” he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled 
along every nerve I had, “you don’t love me, then? It was only my sta- 
tion, and the rank of my wife, that you valued? Now that you think me 
disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I 
were some toad or ape.” 

These words cut me; yet what could I do or say? I ought probably to 
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse 
at thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm 
where I had wounded. 

“I do love you,” I said, “more than ever; but I must not show or in- 
dulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it.” 

“The last time, Jane! What! do you think you can live with me, and 
see me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?” 

“No, sir, that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is 
but one way: but you will be furious if I mention it.” 

“Oh, mention it! If I storm, you have the art of weeping.” 

“Mr. Rochester, I must leave you.” 

“For how long, Jane? For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair 
—which is somewhat dishevelled—and bathe your face—-which looks 
feverish?” 

“I must leave Adéle and Thornfield; I must part with you for my 
whole life; I must begin a new existence amongst strange faces and 
strange scenes,” 

“Of course; I told you you should. I pass over the madness about 
parting from me. You mean you must become a part of me. As to the 
new existence, il is all right: you shall yet be my wife; I am not married. 
You shall be Mrs. Rochester—both virtually and nominally. I shall 
keep only to you so long as you and I live. You shall go to a place I 
have in the south of France~—a whitewashed villa on the shores of the 
Mediterranean. There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most 
innocent life. Never fear that I wish to lure you into error—to make 
you my mistress. Why do you shake your head? Jane, you must be rea~ 
sonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic,” 

His voice and hand quivered; his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed: 
still I dared to speak. 

“Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by 
yourself, If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your mis- 
tress: to say otherwise is sophistical—is false.” 

“Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man—you forget that; I am not 
long-enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate, Out of pity to me and 
yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and—beware|”

He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his 
cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands, 
To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was crucl; to 
yield was out of the question. I did what human beings do instinctively 
when they are driven to utter extremily—looked for aid to one higher 
than man: the words “God help me!” burst involuntarily from my lips. 

“T am a fool!” cried Mr. Rochester suddenly. “I keep telling her I 
am not married, and do not explain to her why. I forget she knows noth- 
ing of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending 
my infernal union with her. Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in 
opinion when she knows all that I know! Just put your hand in mine, 
Janet—that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove 
you are near mc—and I will in a few words show you the real state of 
the case, Can you listen to me?” 

“Ves, sir; for hours if you will.” 

“T ask only minutes. Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not 
the eldest son of my house-—that I had once a brother older than I?” 

“T remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.” 

“And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping 
man?” 

“JT have understood something to that effect.” 

“Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property to- 
gether. He could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving me 
a fair portion; all, he resolved, should go Lo my brother, Rowland. Yet 
as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man. I must. 
be provided for by a wealthy marriage. He sought me a partner betlimes. 
Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old acquain- 
tance. He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made in- 
quiries. Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned 
from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty 
thousand pounds. That sufficed. When I left college, I was sent out to 
Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me. My father said 
nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of 
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie. I found her a fine 
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram—tall, dark, and majestic. Her 
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did 
she. They showed her to me in partics, splendidly dressed, I seldom saw 
her alone, and had very little private conversation with her. She flat- 
tered me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and accom- 
plishments. All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy me. 
T was dazzled, stimulated; my senses were excited; and being ignorant, 
daw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her. There is no folly so be- 
sotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience, the rashness, 


JANE EYRE 263 


the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its commission, Her 
relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she allured me: a mar- 
riage was achieved almost before I knew where I was. Oh, I have no 
respect for mysclf when I think of that act!—an agony of inward con- 
tempt masters me. I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not even know 
her, I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her nature. IT had 
marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor refinement 
in her mind or manners; and I married her—gross grovelling, mole-eyed 
bloékhead that I was! With less sin I might have—But let me remem~ 
ber to whom J am speaking, ~ 

“My bride’s mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead. 
The honeymoon over, I learnt my mistake; she was only mad, and shut 
up in a lunatic asylum. There was a younger brother, too—a complete 
dumb idiot. The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot 
hate, whilst I abhor all his kindred, because he has some grains of affec- 
tion in his feeble mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his 
wretched sister, and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will 
probably be in the same state one day, My father and my brother Row- 
land knew all this; but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, 
and joined in the plot against me. 

“These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of conceal~ 
ment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife, even 
when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious to me, 
her cast of mind commion, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of being 
led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger. When I found that 
I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day, with 
her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained between 
us; because whatever topic I started immediately received from her a 
turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile—when I perceived 
that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because no servant 
would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and unreasonable 
temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory, exacting orders— 
even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I curtailed re- 
monstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in secret; I 
repressed the deep antipathy I felt. 

“Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details; some strong 
words shall express what I have to say. I lived with that woman upstairs 
four years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character 
ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up vast 
and rank; they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I 
would not choose cruelty. What a pigmy intellect she had, and what 
giant propensities! How fearful were the curses those propensities en- 
tailed on me! Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, 


264 JANE EYRE 


dragged me through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must 
attend a man bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste. 

“My brother in the interval was dead, and al the end of the four years 
my father died too. I was rich enough now—yel poor to hideous in- 
digence: a nature the most gross, impure, depraved T ever saw, was as- 
sociated with mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me. 
And I could not rid myself of it by any legal proceedings; for the doc- 
tors now discovered that my wife was mad—her excesses had pre- 
maturely developed the germs of insanity. Jane, you don’t like my nar- 
ralive; you look almost sick—shall I defer the rest to another day?” 

“No, sir, finish it now; I pity you—I do earnestly pity you.” 

“Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of trib- 
ute, which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those whe offer 
it: but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is a 
hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant con- 
tempt for those who have endured them, But that is not your pity, 
Jane; it is not the fecling of which your whole face is full at this mom- 
ent—with which your eyes are now almost overflowing—with which 
your heart is heaving—with which your hand is trembling in mine. Your 
pity, my darling, is the suffering mother of love: ils anguish is the very 
natal pang of the divine passion. I accept it, Jane; let the daughter have 
free advent—my arms wail. Lo receive her.” 

“Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?” 

“Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect 
was all that intervened between me and the gulf. In the cyes of the 
world I was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to 
be clean in my own sight—-and to the last I repudiated the contamina-~ 
tion of her crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her men- 
tal defects. Still, sociely associated my name and person with hers; I 
yet saw her and heard her daily; something of her breath (faugh!) 
mixed with the air I breathed; and besides, I remembered 1 had once 
been her husband—that recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly 
odious to me, Moreover, I knew that while she lived I could never be 
the husband of another and better wife; and, though five years my 
senior (her family and her father had lied to me even in the particular of 
her age), she was likely to live as long as I, being as robust in frame as 
she was infirm in mind. Thus, at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless. 

“One night I had been awakened by her yells—since the medical men 
had pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up. Il was a fierv 
West Indian night; one of the description thal frequently precede the 
hurricanes of those climates. Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and 
opened the window. The air was like sulphur-steams—I could find no 
refreshment anywhere. Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sul- 


JANE EYRE 265 


lenly round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled 
dull like an earthquake; black clouds were casting up over it; the moon 
was setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball—~she 
threw her last bloody glance over a world quivering with ihe ferment of 
tempest. I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and 
my ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shricked out; where- 
in she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, 
with such language!—no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary 
than she: though two rooms off, I heard every word—the thin partitions 
of the West India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish 
cries, 

«This life,’ said I at last, ‘is hell; this is the air, those are the sounds 
of the bottomless pit! I have a right to deliver myself from it if I can. 
The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the heavy flesh that 
now cumbers my soul. Of the fanatic’s burning eternity I have no fear: 
there is not a future state worse than this present one—let me break 
away, and go home to God!’ 

“T said this whilst I knelt down at and unlocked a trunk which con- 
tained a brace of loaded pistols: I meant to shoot myself. I only enter- 
iained the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of 
exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and de- 
sign of self-destruction, was past in a second. 

“A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through 
the open casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and 
the air grew pure, I then framed and fixed a resolution. While I walked 
under the dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its 
drenched pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn 
of the tropics kindled round me, I reasoned thus, Jane; and now listen; 
for it was true Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me 
the right path to follow. 

“The sweet. wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed 
leaves, and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, 
dried up and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with 
living blood—my being longed for renewal—my soul thirsted for a pure 
draught. I saw hope revive—and felt regeneration possible. From a 
flowery arch at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea—bluer 
than the sky: the old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus :— 

* ‘Co,’ said Hope, ‘and live again in Europe: there it is not. known what 
a sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you. You 
may take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due atten- 
dance and precautions at Thornfield; then travel yourself to what clime 
you will, and form what new tie you like, Thal woman, who hag so 
abused your long-suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your hon- 


266 JANE EYRE 


our, so blighted your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband. 
See that she is cared for as her condition demands, and you have done 
all that God and humanity require of you. Let her identity, her conncce- 
tion with yourself, be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them 
to no living being. Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her de- 
gradation with secrecy, and leave her.’ 

“T acted precisely on this suggestion, My father and brother had not 
made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very 
first letter I wrote to apprise them of the union—having already begun 
to experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family 
character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me—I 
added an urgent charge to keep it secret; and very soon the infamous 
conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make 
him blush to own her as his daughter-in-law. Far from desiring to pub- 
lish the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself, 

“To England, then, I conveyed her. A fearful voyage I had with such 
a monster in the vessel. Glad was I when J at last got her to Thornfield, 
and saw her safely lodged in that third-story room, of whose secret in- 
ner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast’s den--~a goblin’s 
cell, I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it was neces- 
sary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed; for her 
ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid inter- 
vals of days—sometimes weeks—which she filled up with abuse of me. 
At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimsby Retreat. She and the sur- 
geon Carter (who dressed Mason’s wounds that night he was stabbed 
and worried) are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence. 
Mrs. Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could have 
gained no precise knowledge as to facts. Grace has, on the whole, 
proved a good keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of 
which it appears nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her har- 
assing profession, her vigilance has been more than once lulled and 
baffled. The lunatic is both cunning and malignant; she has never failed 
to take advantage of her guardian’s temporary Japses-—once to secrete 
the knife with which she stabhed her brother, and twice to possess her- 
self of the key of her cell, and issue therefrom in the night-time. On the 
first of these occasions she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my 
bed; on the second, she paid that ghastly visit to you. T thank Provi- 
dence, who watched over you, that she then spent her fury on your wed- 
ding apparel, which perhaps brought back vague reminiscences of her 
own, bridal days: but on what might have happened, I cannot endure to 
reflect. When I think of the thing which flew at my throat this morning 
oe ita black and scarlet visage over the nest of my dove, my blood 
curdles——~"" 


JANE EYRE 267 


“And what, sir,” I asked, while he paused, “did you do when you had 
settled her here? Where did you go?” 

“What did I do, Jane? I transformed myself into a will-o’-the-wisp. 
Where did I go? I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the March- 
spirit. I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its lands. 
My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent woman, 
whom I could love—a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield-——” 

“But you could not marry, sir.” 

“J had determined and was convinced that I could and ought. It was 
not my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you. I meant to 
tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to 
me so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be 
loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to 
understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I 
was burdened.” 

“Well, sir?” 

“When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile. You 
open your eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a rest- 
less movement, as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, 
and you wanted to read the tablet of one’s heart, But before I go on, 
tell me what you mean by your ‘Well, sir?’ It is a small phrase very 
frequent with you, and which many a time has drawn me on and on 
through interminable talk—I don’t very well know why.” 

“I mean, What next? How did you proceed? What came of such an 
event?” 

“Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?” 

“Whether you found any one you liked; whether you asked her to 
marry you; and what she said.” 

“T can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked 
her to marry me; but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of 
Fate. For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then 
another-—sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in 
Rome, Naples, and Florence, Provided with plenty of money and the 
passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were 
closed against me. I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies, 
French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grifinnen. I could not 
find her. Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought 1 caught a glance, 
heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realization of my 
dream; but I was presently undeceived. You are not to suppose that I 
desired perfection, either of mind or person. I longed only for what 
suited me—for the antipodes of the Creole; and I longed vainly. 
Amongst them all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I~ 
warned as I was of the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous 


268 JANE EYRE 


unions—would have asked to marry me. Disappointment made me reck- 
less. I tried dissipation—never debauchery: that I hated, and hate, 
That was my Indian Messalina’s attribute: rooted disgust at it and her 
restrained me much, even in pleasure. Any enjoyment that bordered on 
riot seemed to approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it. 

“Vet I could not live alone, so I tried the companionship of mis- 
tresses, The first I chose was Céline Varens—another of those steps 
which make a man spurn himself when he recalls them. You already 
know what she was, and how my liaison with her terminated. She had 
two successors—an Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both con~ 
sidered singularly handsome. What was their beauty to me in a few 
weeks? Giacinta was unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three 
months, Clara was honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unim- 
pressible: not one whit to my taste. I was glad to give her a sufficient 
sum to set her up in a good line of business, and so get decently rid of 
her. But, Jane, I see by your face you are not forming a very favourable 
opinion of me just now. You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled 
rake-—don’t your” 

“T don’t like you so well as I have done sometimes, indecd, sir. Did it 
not secm to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one mis~ 
tress and then another? You talk of it as a mere matter of course.” 

“Tt was with me; and I did not like it. It was a grovelling fashion of 
existence: I should never like to return to it. Hiring a mistress is the 
next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always 
by position, inferior; and to live familiarly with inferiors is degrading. 
I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Céline, Giacinta, 
and Clara.” 

I felt the truth of these words; and J drew from them the certain in- 
ference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching that 
had ever been instilled into me, asunder any pretext—with any justi- 
fication—through any temptation—to become the successor of these 
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same fecling which now 
in his mind desecrated their memory. I did not give utterance to this 
conviction; it was enough to feel it. I impressed it on my heart, that it 
might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial, 

“Now, Jane, why don’t you say “Well, sir?’ I have not done. You are 
looking grave, You disapprove of me still, I see. But let me come to the 
point. Last January, rid of all mistresses—in a harsh, bitter frame of 
mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life—corroded with disap- 
pointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against all 
womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual, faithful, 
loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came back to 
England, 


JANE EYRE 269 


“On a frosty winter afternoon I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall. 
Abhorred spot! I expected no peace—no pleasure there. On a stile in 
Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself, I passed it as negli- 
gently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no presentiment 
of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the arbitress of my 
life—my genius for good or evil—waited there in humble guise, I did 
not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour’s accident, it came 
up and gravely offered me help. Childish and slender creature! Tt 
seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to bear me 
on its tiny wing. I was surly; but the thing would not go: it stood by 
me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort of auth- 
ority. I must be aided, and by that hand; and aided I was. 

“When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new—a fresh 
sap and sense—stole into my frame. It was well I had learnt that this 
elf must return to me—that it belonged to my house down below—-or I 
could not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it van. 
ish behind the dim hedge, without singular regret. I heard you come 
home that night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I 
thought of you or watched for you. The next day I observed you—my- 
self unseen—for half an hour, while you played with Adéle in the gal- 
lery. It was a snowy day, I recollect, and you could not go out of doors. 
I was in my room; the door was ajar: I could both listen and watch. 
Adéle claimed your outward attention for a while, yet I fancied your 
thoughts were elsewhere: but you were very patient with her, my little 
Jane; you talked to her and amused her a long time. When at last she 
left you, you lapsed at once into deep reverie; you betook yourself slow- 
ly to pace the gallery. Now and then, in passing a casement, you glanced 
out at the thick-falling snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and 
again you paced gently on and dreamed. I think those day visions were 
not dark: there was a pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, 
a soft excitement in your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypo- 
chondriac brooding: your look revealed rather the sweet musings of 
youth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and 
on to an ideal heaven. The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant 
in the hall, wakened you; and how curiously you smiled to and at your- 
self, Janct! There was much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, 
and seerried to make light of your own abstraction, It seemed to say— 
‘My fine visions are all very well, but I must not forget they are abso- 
lutely unreal. I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; 
bul without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a rough track to irav- 
el, and around me gather black tempests to encounter.’ You ran down- 
stairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house 


270 JANE EYRE 


accounts to make up, or something of that sort, I think it was. T'was 
vexed with you for getting out of my sight. 

“Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my 
presence. An unusual—to me-——a perfectly new character I suspected 
was yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better. You en- 
tered the room with a look and air at once shy and independent. You 
were quaintly dressed—much as you are now. I made you talk: ere long 
T found you full of strange contrasts. Your garb and manner were re- 
stricted by rule; your air was often diffident, and altogether that of one 
refined by nature, but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal 
afraid of making herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some sole- 
cism or blunder; yet when addressed you lifted a keen, a daring, and a 
glowing eye to your interlocutor’s face; there was penctration and power 
in each glance you gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready 
and round answers. Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe 
you felt the existence of sympathy between you and your grim and cross 
master, Jane; for it was astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleas- 
ant ease tranquillized your manner. Snarl as I would, you showed no 
surprise, fear, annoyance, or displeasure at my moroseness; you watched 
me, and now and then smiled at me with a simple yet sagacious grace I 
cannot describe. I was at once content and stimulated with what I saw; 
I liked what I had seen, and wished to see more. Yet, for a long time, T 
treated you distantly, and sought your company rarely, I was an intel- 
lectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of making this 
novel and piquant acquaintance. Besides, I was for a while troubled 
with a haunting fear that if I handled the flower freely its bloom would 
fade—the sweet charm of freshness would leave it, I did not then know 
that it was no transitory blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance 
of one cut in an indestructible gem, Moreover, I wished to see whether 
you would seek me if I shunned you: but you did not; you kept in the 
schoolroom as still as your own desk and easel. If by chance I met you, 
you passed me as soon, and with as little token of recognition, as was 
consistent with respect. Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, 
was a thoughtful look—not despondent, for you were not sickly; but 
not buoyant, for you had little hope and no actual pleasure. I wondered 
what you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and resolved to 
find this out. 

“I resumed my notice of you. There was something glad in your 
glance, and genial in your manner, when you conversed. I saw you had a 
social heart: it was the silent schoolroom—it was the tedium of your life 
~~that made you mournful. I permitted myself the delight of being kind 
to you; kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expres- 
sion, your tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a. 


JANE EYRE 27 


grateful, happy accent, I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, 
at this time: there was a curious hesitation in your manner. You glanced 
at me with a slight trouble—a hovering doubt: you did not know what 
my caprice might be—whcther I was going to play the master and be 
stern, or the friend and be benignant. I was now too fond of you often 
to simulate the first whim; and, when 1 stretched my hand out cordially, 
such bloom and light and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I 
had much ado often to avoid straining you then and there to my heart.” 

“Don’t talk any more of those days, sir,” I interrupted, furtively 
dashing away some tears from my eyes. His language was torture to 
me; for T knew what I must do—and do soon—and all these reminis- 
cences, and these revelations of his feelings, only made my work more 
difficult. 

“No, Jane,” he returned: “what necessity is there to dwell on the 
Past, when the Present is so much surer—the Future so much brighter?” 

J shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion. 

“You see now how the case stands—do you not?” he continued. 
“After a youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half 
in dreary solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love— 
T have found you. You are my sympathy—my better self—my good an- 
gel. I am bound to you with a strong attachment. I think you good, 
gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conccived in my heart; it 
leans to you, draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my ex-~ 
istence about you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and 
me in one. 

“It was because I felt and knew this that I resolved to marry you. To 
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery; you know now that 
T had but a hideous demon. I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but 
I feared a stubbornness that exists in your character. I feared early in- 
stilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding confi- 
dences. This was cowardly, I should have appealed to your nobleness 
and magnanimity at first, as I do now—opened to you plainly my life of 
agony—described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worth- 
ier existence—shown to you, not my resolution (that word is weak), but 
my resistless bent to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and 
well loved in return. Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge 
of fidelily and to give me yours. Jane—give il me now.” 

A pause. 

“Why are you silent, Jane?” 

I was experiencing an ordeal: 9 hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals. 
Terrible moment! full of struggle, blackness, burning! Not a human 
being that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and 
him who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce 


272 JANE EYRE 


love and idol. One drear word comprised my intolerable duty— 
“Depart!” 

“Jane, you understand what I want of you? Just this promise-—‘T will 
be yours, Mr. Rochester.’ ” 

“Mr, Rochester, I will wot be yours.” 

Another long silence. 

“Jane!” recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with 
grief, and turned me stone-cold with ominous lerror—for this still voice 
was the pant of a lion rising—‘Jane, do you mean to go one way in the 
world, and to let me go another?” 

aT do, 3 

“Jane” (bending towards and embracing me), “do you mean it now?” 

OT do. ” 

“And now?” softly kissing my forehead and cheek, 

“¥ do,” extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely. 

“Oh, Jane, this is bitter! This—this is wicked! It would not be 
wicked to love me,” 

“It would to obey you.” 

A wild look raised his brows-—~crossed his features: he rose; but he 
forbore yet. I Jaid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I shook, 
I feared—but I resolved. © 

“One instant, Jane. Give one glance to my horrible life when you are 
gone. All happiness will be torn away with you. What then is Jeft? For 
a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to 
some corpse in yonder churchyard. What shall I do, Jane? Where turn 
for a companion and for some hope?” 

‘Do as I do: trust in God and yourself. Believe in heaven. Hope to 
meet again there,” 

“Then you will not yield?” 

No.” 

“Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?” His 
voice rose. 

“T advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil.” 

“Then you snatch love and innocence from me? You fling me back 
on lust for a passion—vice for an occupation?” 

“Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it 
for myself. We were born to strive and endure—you ag well as I: do so, 
You will forget me before I forget you.” 

“You make me a liar by such language; you sully my honour, I de- 
clared I could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon. 
And what a distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your 
ideas, is proved by your conduct! Is it better to drive a fellow-creature 
to despair than to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured 


JANE EYRE 273 


by the breach?——for you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom 
you need fear to offend by living with me?” 

This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason 
turned traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him. 
They spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly, “Oh, 
comply!” it said. “Think of his misery; think of his danger—look at 
his state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the 
recklessness following on despair—soothe him; save him; love him; tell 
him you love him and will be his. Who in the world cares for you? or 
who will be injured by what you do?” 

Still indomitably was the reply—“ care for myself. The more soli- 
tary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will 
respect myself, I will keep the law given by God, sanctioned by man. I 
will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not mad 
—as I am now. Laws and principles are not for the times when there 
is no temptation; they are for such moments as this, when body and soul 
rise in mutiny against their rigour: stringent are they; inviolate they 
shall be. If at my individual convenience I might break them, what 
would be their worth? They have a worth—so I have always believed; 
and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane—quite insane: 
with my veins running “re, and my heart beating faster than I can count 
its throbs. Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I 
have at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot.” 

I did. Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so. 
His fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment, 
whatever followed. He crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped 
my waist. He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, 
I felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and 
glow of a furnace; mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the 
certainty of ultimate safety. The soul, fortunately, has an interpreter— 
often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter—in the eye. My 
eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I gave an involun- 
tary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my overtaxed sirength almost 
exhausted, 

“Never,” said he, as he ground his teeth, “never was anything at once 
so frail and so indomitable. A mere reed she feels in my hand!” (And 
he shook me with the force of his hold.) “I could bend her with my fin- 
ger and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I 
crushed her? Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing 
looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage—with a stern 
triumph, Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it~the savage, 
beautiful creature! If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will 
only let the captive loose. Conqueror I might be of the house; but the 


274 JANE EYRE 


inmate would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of 
its clay dwelling-place. And it is you, spirit—with will and energy, and 
virtue and purity—that I want: not alone your brittle frame. Of your- 
self you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you 
would: seized against your will, you will clude the grasp like an essence 
—you will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance. Oh! come, Jane, come!” 

As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me. 
‘The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot, 
however, would have succumbed now. I had dared and baffled his fury; 
I must elude his sorrow. I retired to the door, 

“Vou are going, Jane?” 

“T am going, sir,” 

“You are leaving me?” 

Vas,” 

“Vou will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer? My 
elecp love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to your” 

What unutterable pithos was in his voice! How hard it was to re- 
iterate firmly, “I am going.” 

tc Jane!” 

“Mr. Rochester!” 

“Withdraw, then,—I consent; but remember, you leave me here in 
anguish. Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, 
cast a glance on my sufferings—think of me.” 

He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa. “O Jane! 
my hope—my love—my life!” broke in anguish from his lips. Then 
came a deep, strong sob. 

T had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back—walked 
back as determinedly as I had retreated. I knelt down by him; I turned 
his face from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair 
with my hand. 

“God bless you, my dear master!” I said. “God keep you from harm 
and wrong—direct you, solace you—reward you well for your past kind- 
ness to me.” 

“Little Jane's love would have been my best reward,” he answered; 
“without it, my heart is broken. But Jane will give me her love; yes—~ 
nobly, generously.” 

Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes; 
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at 
once quitted the room. 

“Farewell!” was the cry of my heart as I left him. Despair added, 
“Farewell for ever!” 

* * * * * 
That night I never thought of sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon 


JANE EYRE 275 


as I lay down in bed. I was transported in thought to the scenes of 
childhood. I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night 
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears. The light that 
long ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glid- 
ingly to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the 
obscured ceiling. I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to 
clouds, high and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to va~ 
pours she is about to sever. I watched her come—watched with the 
strangest anticipation—as though some word of doom were to be written 
on her disk. She broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a 
hand first penetrated the sable folds anf waved them away; then, not a 
moon, but a white human form shone in the azure, inclining a glorious 
brow earthward. It gazed and gazed on me. It spoke to my spirit: im- 
measurably distant was the tone, yet so near, it whispered in my heart,— 

“My daughter, flee temptation.” 

“Mother, I will,” 

So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream. It was 
yet night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes. 
“It cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil,” thought 
I. I rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes, I 
knew where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring. In seek- 
ing these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. 
Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago. I left that; it was 
not mine: it was the visionary bride’s who had melted in air. The other 
articles I made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it 
was all I had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned 
my shawl, took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, 
and stole from my room. 

“Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!” I whispered, as I glided past her door. 
“Tarewell, my darling Adéle!” I said, as I glanced towards the nursery. 
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her. I had to de- 
ceive a fine ear: for aught I knew, it might now be listening. 

I would have got past Mr. Rochester’s chamber without a pause; but 
my heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was 
forced to stop also. No sleep was there: the inmate was walking rest- 
lessly from wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened. 
There was a heaven-——a temporary heaven—in this room for me, if I 
chose: I had but to go in and to say, “Mr. Rochester, I will love you 
and live with you through life till death,” and a fount of rapture would 
spring to my lips. I thought of this. 

That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impa- 
tience for day, He would send for me in the morning: I should be gone. 
He would have me sought for: vainly. He would feel himself forsaken; 


276 JANE EYRE 


his love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate. I thought 
of this too. My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and 
glided on. 

Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and J 
did it mechanically. I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen. I 
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock, I 
got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk 
far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down, All 
this I did without one sound. I opened the door, passed out, shut it 
softly. Dim dawn glimmered in the yard. The great gates were closed 
and locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched. Through that 
I departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield. 

A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the con- 
trary direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often no- 
ticed, and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps. No reflection 
was Lo be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one 
forward. Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the fu- 
ture. The first was a page so heavenly sweet—so deadly sad—that to 
read one line of it would dissolve my courage and break down my en- 
ergy. The last was an awful blank—something like the world when the 
deluge was gone by. 

I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise. I believe it 
was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on 
when I left the house, were soon wet with dew. But I looked neither to 
rising sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature. He who is Laken out to 
pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that 
smile on his road, bul of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of 
bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear 
flight and homeless wandering—and oh! with agony I thought of what I 
left, I could not help it. I thought of him now—in his room—watching 
the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and 
be his, I longed to be his; I panied to return. It was not too late; I 
could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement. As yet my flight, I 
was sure, was undiscovered. I could go back and be his comforter~his 
pride; his redecmer from miscry, perhaps [rom ruin. Oh, that fear of his 
self-abandonment—far worse than my abandonmenl—how it goaded 
me! It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried 
to extract it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in, 
Birds began singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their 
mates; birds were emblems of love. What was I? In the midst of my 
pain of heart and frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself, I had 
no solace from self-approbation; none even from self-respect. I had in- 
Jured--wounded—left my master. I was hateful in my own eyes. Still 


JANE EYRE 277 


I could not turn, nor retrace one step. God must have led me on. As to 
my own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and 
stifled the other. I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary 
way: fast, fast I went like one delirious. A weakness, beginning inward- 
ly, extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell. I lay on the ground 
some minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf. I had some fear-—or 
hope-—that here I should die; but I was soon up, crawling forwards on 
my hands and knees, and then again raised to my feet—as eager and as 
determined as ever to reach the road. 

When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and 
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on. I stood up and 
lifted my hand; it stopped, I asked where it was going: the driver 
named a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had 
no connections. I asked for what sum he would take me there: he said 
thirty shillings. I answered I had but twenty: well, he would try to 
make it do. He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the ve- 
hicle was empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way. 

Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes 
never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from 
mine. May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so 
agonized as in that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread 
to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love. 


CHAPTER XXVIII 


Two days are passed. It is a summer evening. The coachman has set 


me down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no further for 
the sum I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the 
world. The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone. At this mom- 
ent I discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the 
coach, where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must 
remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute. 

Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up 
where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at 
a distance aiid in darkness. Four arms spring from its summit: the near- 
est town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten 
miles; the farthest, above twenty. From the well-known names of these 
towns I learn in what county I have lighted—a north-midland shire, 
dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see. There are great 
moors behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far 
beyond that deep valley at my feet. The population here must be thin, 
and I see no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, 


278 JANE EYRE 


north, and south—white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and 
the heather grows deep and wild to their very verge. Yet a chance trav- 
eller might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would 
wonder what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently ob- 
jectless and lost. I might be questioned: I could give no answer but 
what would sound incredible and excite suspicion. Not a tic holds me to 
human society at this moment—not a charm or hope calls me where 
my fellow-creatures are—none that saw me would have a kind thought 
or a good wish for me. J have no relative but the universal mother, Na- 
ture: I will seek her breast and ask repose. 

T struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply 
furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I 
turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a 
hidden angle, [ sat down under it. High banks of moor were about me; 
the crag protected my head; the sky was over that. 

Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here. I had a vague 
dread that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher 
might discover me. If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fear- 
ing it was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man, 
Vinding my Apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep 
siletice that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence. 
As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded: now I 
regained the faculty of reflection, 

What was I to do? Where to go? Oh, intolerable questions, when I 
could do nothing and go nowhere!-—when a long way must yet be 
measured by my weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human 
habitation—when cold charity must be entreated before I could get 
a lodging; reluctant sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse in- 
alsa before my tale could be listened to, or one of my wants re- 
ieved |! 

I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the 
summer day. I looked at the sky: it was pure; a kindly star twinkled 
just above the chasm ridge. The dew fell, but with propitious softness: 
no breeze whispered. Nature seemed to me benign and good. I thought 
she loved me, outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate 
only mistrust, rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness. To- 
night, at least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother 
would lodge me without money and without price, I had one morsel of 
bread yet: the remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed 
through at noon with a stray penny—my last coin, I saw ripe bilberries 
gleaming here and there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a hand- 
ful and ate them with the bread. My hunger, sharp before, was, if not 


JANE EYRE 299 


satisfied, appeased by this hermit’s meal. I said my evening prayers at 
its conclusion, and then chose my couch. 

Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet 
were buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space 
for the night air to invade. I folded my shawl double, and spread it over 
me for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow. Thus lodged, T 
was not, at least at the commencement of the night, cold. 

My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it. 
It plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords. It 
trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bit- 
ter pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a 
bird with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions im 
vain attempts to seek him, 

Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees. Night was 
come, and her planets were risen: a safe, Still night: too serene for the 
companionship of fear. We know that God is everywhere; but cer- 
tainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest 
scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night sky, where His 
worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, 
His omnipotence, His omnipresence. I had risen to my knees to pray 
for Mr, Rochester. Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the 
mighty Milky-way. Remembering what it was—what countless systems 
there swept space like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength 
of God. Sure was I of His efficiency to save what He had made; con- 
vinced I grew that neither carth should perish, nor one of the souls it 
treasured. I turned my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was 
also the Saviour of spirits. Mr. Rochester was safe: he was God’s, and 
by God would he be guarded. I again nestled to the breast of the hill, 
and ere long in sleep forgot sorrow. 

But next day Want came to me pale and bare, Long after the little 
birds had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime 
of day to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried—when the 
long morning shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky 
~—I got up, and I looked round me. 

What a still, hot, perfect day! What a golden desert this spreading 
moor! Everywhere sunshine. I wished I could live in it and on it. I 
saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet bil- 
berries. 1 would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I 
might have found filting nutriment, permanent shelter here. But J was 
a human being, and had a human being’s wants: I must not linger where 
there was nothing to supply them. I rose; I loaked back at the bed I 
had left. Hopeless of the future, I wished but this—that my Maker had 
that night thought good to require my soul of me while E slept; and that 


280 JANE EYRE 


this weary frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had 
mow but to decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this 
wilderness. Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its re- 
quirements, and pains, and responsibilities, The burden must be car- 
ried; the want provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility 
fulfilled. I set out. 

Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now 
fervent and high, By no other circumstance had I will to decide my 
choice, I walked a long time; and when I thought I had nearly done 
enough, and might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost over- 
powered me—might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a 
stone I saw near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart 
and limb—I heard a bell chime—a church bell. 

I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the roman- 
tic hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, T 
saw a hamlet and a spire. All the valley at my right hand was full of 
pasture-fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran 
zigzag through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the 
sombre woodland, the clear and sunny lea. Recalled by the rumbling of 
wheels to the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden wagon labouring up 
the hill, and not far beyond were two cows and their drover. Human 
life and human labour were near, I must struggle on—strive to live and 
bend to toil like the rest. 

About two o’clock p.m. I entered the village. At the bottom of 
its one street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the 
window. I coveted a cake of bread. With that refreshment I could per- 
haps regain a degree of energy; without it, it would be difficult to pro- 
ceed, The wish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me 
ag soon as I was amongst my fellew-beings. I felt it would be degrad- 
ing to faint with hunger on the causeway of a hamlet. Had I nothing 
about me I could offer in exchange for one of these rolls? I considered. 
Thad a small silk handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves. 
T could hardly tell how men and women in extremities of destitution 
proceeded. I did not know whether either of these articles would be ac- 
cepted: probably they would not; but I must try. 

I entered the shop: a woman was there, Secing a respectably dressed 
person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility. How 
could she serve me? I was seized with shame; my tongue would not 
utier the request I had prepared. I dared not offer her the half-worn 
gloves, the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd. I 
only begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired. Disap- 
Pointed in the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my re- 
quest. She pointed to a seat; I sank into it. I felt sorely urged to weep; 


JANE EYRE 284 


but conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I re- 
strained it. Soon I asked her “if there were any dressmaker or plain- 
work-woman in the village?” 

“Yes; two or three. Quite as many as there was employment for.” 

I reflected. I was driven to the point now. I was brought face to face 
with Necessity. I stood in the position of one without a resource, with- 
out a friend, without a coin. I must do something. What? I must ap- 
ply somewhere. Where? 

“Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant 
was wanted?” 

“Nay; she couldn’t say.” 

“What was the chief trade in this place? What did most of the people 
do?” 

“Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr, Oliver’s 
needle-factory, and at the foundry.” 

“Did Mr. Oliver employ women?” 

“Nay; it was men’s work.” 

“And what do the women do?” 

“TI knawn’t,” was the answer. “Some does one thing, and some an- 
other. Poor folk mun get on as they can.” 

She seemed to be tired of my questions; and, indeed, what claim had 
I to importune her? A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evi- 
dently wanted. I took leave. 

I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right 
hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an in- 
ducement, to enter any. I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes 
to a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more. Much ex- 
hausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside into 
a lane and sat down under the hedge. Ere many minutes had elapsed, T 
was again on my feet, however, and again searching for something—a 
resource, or at least an informant. A pretty little house stood at the top 
of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and brilliantly 
blooming. I stopped at it. What business had I to approach the white 
door or touch the glittering knocker? In what way could it possibly be 
the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me? Yet I 
drew near and knocked. A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman 
opened the door. In such a voice as might be expected from a hepeless 
heart and fainting frame—a voice wretchedly low and faltcring—~I 
asked if a servant was wanted here? 

“No,” said she; “we do not keep a servant.” 

“Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?” I con- 
tinued. “I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place. I want 
some work—no matter what.” 


82 JANE EYRE 


But it was not her business to think for me, or to seck a place for 
me: besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my char- 
acler, position, tale. She shook her head, she “was sorry she could give 
me no information,” and the white door closed, quile gently and civilly; 
but it shut me out, If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I 
should have begged a piece of bread, for I was now brought low. 

I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no 
prospect of aid was visible. I should have longer rather to deviate to a 
wood I saw not far off, which appeared in ils thick shade to offer in- 
viting shelter; bul I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature’s crav- 
ings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance 
of food. Solitude would be no solitude, rest no rest, while the vulture, 
hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side. 

I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I 
wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no 
claim to ask, no right to expect interest in my isolated lot. Meantime, 
the afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and 
starving dog. In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I 
hastened towatds it, Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a gar- 
den, stood a well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was 
the parsonage. I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where 
they have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to 
the clergyman for introduction and aid. It is the clergyman’s function 
to help—at least with advice—those who wished to help themselves, I 
seemed to have something like a right to seek counsel here. Renewing 
then my courage, and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed 
on. I reached the house and knocked at the kitchen-door. An old wo- 
man opened. I asked was this the parsonage? 

Ves? 

“Was the clergyman in?” 

“No.” 

“Would he be in soon?” 

“No, he was gone from home,” 5 

“To a distance?” 

“Not so fat—happen three mile. He had been called away by the 
sudden death of his father. He was at Marsh End now, and would very 
likely stay there a fortnight longer,” 

“Was there any lady of the house?” 

“Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;” and of 
hey, reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was 
sinking—I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away. 

Once more I took off my handkerchief—once more I thought of the 
cakes of bread in the little shop. Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouth- 


JANE EYRE 283 


ful to allay the pang of famine! Instinctively I turned my face again 
to the village. I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others 
were there besides the woman, I ventured the request—“Would she 
give me a roll for this handkerchief?” 

She looked at me with evident suspicion: “Nay, she never sold stuff 
i’ that way.” 

Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused, “How 
could she tell where I had got the handkerchicf?” she said. 

“Would she take my gloves?” 

“No! what could she do with them?” 

Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details. Some say there 
is enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past, but at this day 
I can scarcely bear to review the times io which I allude; the moral 
degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a 
recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on. I blamed none of those who 
repulsed me, I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not 
be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a 
well-dressed beggar inevitably so, To be sure, what I begged was em- 
ployment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment? 
Not, cerlainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and 
who knew nothing about my character. And as to the woman who would 
not take my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was 
right, if the offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable. 
Let me condense now; I am sick of the subject, 

A little before dark I passed a farmhouse, at the open door of which 
the farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese. J stopped 
and said,— 

“Will you give me a piece of bread, for I am very hungry?” He cast 
on me a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice 
from his loaf, and gave il to me. I imagine he did not think I was a 
beggar, but only en eccentric sort of Jady, who had taken a fancy to his 
brown loaf. As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and 
ate it. 

I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the 
wood J have before alluded to. But my night was wretched, my rest 
broken. The ground was damp, the air cold; besides, intruders passed 
near me more than once, and I had again and again to change my quar- 
ters: no sense of safety or tranquillity befriended me. Towards morn- 
ing it rained; the whole of the following day it was wet. Do not ask me, 
reader, to give a minute account of that day: as before, I sought work; 
as before, I was repulsed; as before, I starved—but once did food pags 
my lips. At the door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a 


284 JANE EYRE 


mess of cold porridge into a pig trough. “Will you give me that?” I 
asked, 

She stared at me. “Mother!” she exclaimed, “there is a woman wants 
me to give her these porridge.” 

“Well, lass,” replied a voice within, “give it her if she’s a beggar. T’ 
pig doesn’t want it.” 

The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured 
it ravenously. 

As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, 
which I had been pursuing an hour or more. 

“My strength is quite failing me,” I said in soliloquy. “I feel I can- 
not go much farther. Shall I be an outcast again this night? While the 
rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground? I 
fear I cannot do otherwise; for who will receive me? But it will be 
very dreadful, with (his feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense 
of desolation—this lotal prostration of hope. In all likelihood, though, 
T should die before morning. And why cannot I reconcile myself to the 
prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life? Be- 
cause I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of 
want and cold is a fale to which nature cannot submit passively. O 
Providence! sustain me a little longer! Aid!—direct me!” 

My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape. I saw I 
had strayed far from the village; it was quite out of sight. The very 
cullivalion surrounding it had disappeared, I had, by cross-ways and 
by-paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a 
few fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which 
they were scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill. 

“Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented 
road,” I reflected. “And far better that crows and ravens—if any ravens 
there be in these regions—~should pick my flesh from my bones, than 
that they should ve prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a 
pauper’s grave.” 

To the hill, then, I turned. I reached it. It remained now only to find 
a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure, 
But all the surface of the waste looked level. It showed no variation 
but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew Lhe marshes; black, 
where the dry soil bore only heath. Dark as it was getting, I could still 
see these changes, {hough but as mere alterations of light and shade, for 
colour had faded with the daylight. 

My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor edge, 
vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in 
among the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up. “That is an igais 
jatuus,” was my first thought, and I expected it would soon vanish, It 


JANE EYRE 285 


burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing. “Is 
it, then, a bonfire just kindled?” I questioned. I watched to see whether 
it would spread. But no; as it did not diminish, so it did not enlarge. 
“It may be a candle in a house,” I then conjectured; “but if so, I can 
never reach it. It is much too far away; and were ii within a yard of 
me, what would it avail? I should but knock at the door to have it shut 
in my face.” 

And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground. 
T lay still a while, The night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and 
died moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the 
skin. Could I but have stiffened io the still frost—the friendly numb- 
ness of death—it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it; but 
my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence. I rose ere long, 

The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain. I 
tried to walk again; I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it. It 
led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been 
impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now in the 
height of summer. Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my 
faculties. This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it. 

Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor, T 
approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light, 
which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees—firs, 
apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their 
forms and foliage through the gloom. My star vanished as I drew near: 
some obstacle had intervened between me and it. I put out my hand to 
feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a 
low wall—above it, something like palisades; and within, a high and 
prickly hedge. I groped on. Again a whitish object gleamed before me: 
it was a gate—a wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it. On each 
side stood a sable bush—holly or yew. 

Entering the gate, and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house 
rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone 
nowhere. All was obscurity. Were the inmates retired to restr I feared 
it must be so. In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot oul the 
friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small latticed 
window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the growth of 
ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick over the 
portion of the house wall in which it was set. The aperture was so 
screened and narrow that curtain or shutter had been deemed unnec- 
essary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage 
shooting over it, I could see all within. I could sce clearly a room with 
a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter plates 
ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat 


286 JANE EYRE 


fire. I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs. The candle, 
whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its light an 
elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean, like 
all about her, was knitting a stocking. 

I noticed these objects cursorily only: in them there was nothing ex- 
traordinary. A group of more interest appearcd near the hearth, sitting 
still amidst the rosy peace and warmth sullusing it. Two young, graceful 
women—ladies in every point—sat, one in a low rocking-chair, the other 
on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and bombazeen, 
which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and faces: a large 
old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one girl; in the 
lap of the other was cushioned a black cat. 

A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants, Who 
were they? They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at 
the table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and 
cultivation. I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs; and yet, as I 
gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lincament. 1 cannot call 
them handsome—they were too pale and grave for the word: as they 
each bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity, A 
stand between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, 
to which they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with 
the smaller books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dic- 
tionary to aid them in the task of translation. This scene was as silent 
as if all the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a pic- 
ture: so hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the 
clock tick in its obscure corner; and JI even fancied I could distinguish 
the click-click of the woman’s knitting-necdles, When, therefore, a 
voice broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me, 

“Listen, Diana,” said one of the absorbed students. “Franz and old 
Daniel are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from 
which he has awakened in terror—listen!” And in a low voice she read 
something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in 
an unknown tongue—neither French nor Latin. Whether it were Greek 
or German, I could not tell. 

“That is strong,” she said, when she had finished: “T relish it.’ The 
other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated, while 
she gazed at the fire, a line of what hact been read. At a later day I 
knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the line: 
though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on sounding brass 
to me, conveying no meaning :-— 

“Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht,’ Good! 
good!” she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled, ‘There 
you have a dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you! The line is 


JANE EYRE 287 


worth a hundred pages of fustian. ‘Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale 
meines Zornes und dic Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms,’ I 
like it!” 

Both were again silent. 

“Ts there ony country where they talk i’? that way?” asked the old 
woman, looking up from her knitting. 

“Ves, Hannah—a far larger country than England, where they talk 
in no other way.” 

“Well, for sure case, I knawn’t how they can understand t’one t’other: 
and if either o’ ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?” 

“We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all—for 
we are not as clever as you think us, Hannah. We don’t speak German, 
and we cannot read it without a dictionary to help us.” 

“And what good does it do your” 

“We mean to teach it some time—or at least the elements, as they 
say; and then we shall get more money than we do now.” 

“Varry like: but give ower studying; ye’ve done enough for to-night.” 

“I think we have-—at least I’m tired. Mary, are you?” 

“Mortally. After all, it’s tough work fagging away at a language with 
no master but a lexicon.” 

“Tt is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch. 
I wonder when St. John will come home.” 

“Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold 
watch she drew from her girdle), It rains fast. Hannah, will you have 
the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?” 

The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a 
passage: soon J heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently 
came back. 

“Ah, childer!” said she, “it fair troubles me to go into yond’ room 
now; it looks so lonesome wi’ the chair empty and set back in a corner.” 

She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, look- 
ed sad now. 

“But he is in a better place,” continued Hannah: “we shouldn’t wish 
him here again, And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he 
had,” 

“Vou say he never mentioned us?” inquired one of the ladies, 

“He hadn’t time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father. 
He had been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and 
when Mr, St. John asked if he would like cither 0’ ye to be sent for, he 
fair laughed at him, He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head 
the next day—that is, 4 fortnight sin’-—and he went to sleep and niver 
wakened: he wor a’most stark when your brother went into t’ chamber 
and fand him, Ah, childer! that’s t’ Jast o’ t? old stock—for ye and Mr. 


288 JANE EYRE 


St. John is like of different soart to them ’at’s gone; for all your mother 
wor mich i’ your way, and a’most as book-learned. She wor the pictur’ 
0’ ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father.” 

I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for 
such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference. Both were fair 
complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinc- 
tion and intelligence, One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the 
other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it: Mary’s pale 
brown locks were parted and braided smooth; Diana’s duskier tresses 
covered her neck with thick curls. The clock struck ten. 

“Ve'll want your supper, I am sure,” observed Hannah; “and so will 
Mr, St. John when he comes in.” 

And she proceeded to prepare the meal. The ladies rose; they seemed 
about to withdraw 1o the parlour. Till this moment, I had been so in- 
tent on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited 
in me so keen an interest, I had half-forgotlen my own wretched posi- 
tion: now it recurred to me. More desolate, more desperate than ever. 
it seemed from contrast, And how impossible did it appear to touch the 
inmates of this house with concern on my behalf; to make them be- 
lieve in the truth of my wants and wocs—to induce them to vouchsafe 
a rest for my wanderings! As I groped out the door, and knocked at it 
hesitalingly, I felt that last idea to be a mere chimera, Hannah opened. 

“What do you want?” she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she sur- 
veyed me by the light of the candle she held, 

“May I speak to your mistresses?” I said. 

“You had better tell me what you have to say to them, Where do you 
come from?” 

“T am a stranger.” 

“What is your business here at this hour?” 

“T want a night’s shelter in an oul-house or anywhere, and a morsel 
of bread to eat,” 

Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hamnah’s face. “Wl 
give you a piece of bread,”. she said, after a pause; “but we can’t take in 
& vagrant Lo lodge. It isn’t likely.” 

“Do Jet me speak Lo your mistresses.” 

“No, not I, What can they do for you? You should not be roving 
about now; it looks very ill.” 

“But where shall I go if you drive me away? What shall I do?” 

“Oh, VIL warrant you know where to go and what to do. Mind you 
don’t do wrong, (hat’s all. Here is a penny; now go——” 

“A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go further. 
Don’t shut the door:—oh, don’t, for God’s sake!” 


“T must; the rain is driving in——” 


JANE EYRE 289 


“Tell the young ladies. Let me see them me 

“Indeed, I will not. You are not what you ought to be, or you would- 
n’t make such a noise. Move off.” 

“But I must die if I am turned away.” 

“Not you. I’m fear’d you have some ill plans agate, that bring you 
about folk’s houses at this time o’ night. If you’ve any followers—~ 
housebreakers or such like—anywhere near, you may tell them we are 
not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and 
guns.” Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and 
bolted it within. 

This was the climax, A pang of exquisite suffering—-a throe of true 
despair—rent and heaved my heart. Worn out, indeed, I was; not an- 
other step could I stir. I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned—I wrung 
my hands—I wept in utter anguish. Oh, this spectre of death! Oh, this 
last hovr, approaching in such horror! Alas, this isolation—this banish- 
ment from my kind! Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of 
fortitude was gone—at least for a moment; but the last I soon endeav- 
oured to regain. 

“T can but die,” I said, “and I believe in God, Let me try to wait 
His will in silence.” 

These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all 
my misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there 
dumb and still. 

“All men must dic,” said a voice quite close at hand; ‘“‘but all are not 
condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours 
would be if you perished here of want.” 

“Who or what speaks?” I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, 
and incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid. A 
form was near—what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled 
vision prevented me from distinguishing. With a loud, long knock, the 
new-comer appealed to the door. 

“Ts it you, Mr. St. John?” cried Hannah. 

“Ves—yes; open quickly!” 

“Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is! 
Come in—your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there 
are bad folks about. There has been a beggar-woman—1 declare she is 
not gone yet !—laid down there—Get up! for shame! Move off, I say!” 

“Hush, Hannah! I have a word to say to the woman. You have done 
your duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her, I was 
near, and listened to both you and her, I think this is a peculiar case— 
I must at least examine into it-—Young woman, rise, and pass before me 
into the house.” 

With difficulty I obeyed him. Presently I stood within that clean, 


290 JANE EYRE 


bright kitchen—on the very hearth—trembling, sickening; conscious of 
an aspect in the Jast degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten, The two 
ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at me. 

“St. John, who is it?” I heard one ask. 

“T cannot tell: I found her at the door,” was the reply. 

“She does look white,” said Hannah. 

“As white as clay or death,” was responded. “She will fall: let her 
sit,” 

And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me. I 
still possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak, 

“Perhaps a little water would restore her. Hannah, fetch some. But 
she is worn to nothing, How very thin, and how very bloodless!” 

“A mere spectre!” 

“Js she ill, or only famished?” 

‘Famished, I think. Hannah, is that milk? Give it me, and a piece of 
bread,” 

Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between 
me and the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in 
milk, and put it to my lips, Her face was near mine: I saw there was 
pity in it, and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing. In her simple 
words, too, the same balm-like emotion spoke: “Try to cat.” 

“Yes—try,” repeated Mary gently; and Mary’s hand removed my 
sodden bonnet and lifted my head. I tasted what they offered me: 
feebly at first, eagerly soon. 

“Not too much at first—vrestrain her,” said the brother; “she has had 
enough.” And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread. 

“A little more, St, John—~look at the avidity in her eyes.” 

“No more at present, sister. Try if she can speak now—ask her her 
name,” 

I felt. I could speak, and I answered—“My name is Jane Elliott.” 
oe as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an 
alias. 

“And where do you live? Where are your friends?” 

I was silent. 

“Can we send for any one you know?” 

t shook my head, 

“What account can you give of yourself?” 

Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, 
and once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer out- 
cast, vagrant, and disowned by the wide world. I dared to put off the 
mendicant—to resume my natural manner and character. I began once 
more to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account-- 


JANE EYRE 201 


which at present I was far too weak to render—I said after a brief 
pause,— 

“Sir, I can give you no details to-night.” 

“But what, then,” said he, “do you expect me to do for you?” 

“Nothing,” I replied. My strength sufficed for but short answers. 
Diana took the word. 

“Do you mean,” she asked, “that we have now given you what aid 
you require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy 
night?” 

I looked at her, She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, in- 
stinct both with power and goodness, I took sudden courage. Answer- 
ing her compassionate gaze with a smile, I said—“I will trust you. If I 
were a masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me 
from your hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear. Do with me 
and for me as you like; bul excuse me from much discourse—my breath 
is short—I feel a spasm when I speak.” All three surveyed me, and all 
three were silent. 

“Hannah,” said Mr. St. John, at last, “let her si there at present, and 
ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of 
that milk and bread. Mary and Diana, Iet us go into the parlour and 
talk the matter over.” 

They withdrew. Very soon one of the ladies returned—I could nat 
tell which. A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by 
the genial fire, In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah. 
Ere long, with the servant’s aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my 
dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me. I 
thanked God—-experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of 
grateful joy—and slept, 


CHAPTER XXIX 


Tae recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very 
dim in my mind. I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but 
few thoughts framed, and no actions nerfermed. I knew I was ina small 
room and in a narrow bed. To that hed I seemed to have grown, I lay 
on it motioniess as a stone; and to have tern me from it would have 
been almost to kul me. I took no note of the lapse of time—of the 
change from morning to noon, from noon to evening. I observed when 
any one entered or lett the apartment—I could even tell who they were; 
I could understand what was said when the speaker sLood near to me; 
but I could not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally 
impossible. Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor. Her 


292 JANE EYRE 


coming disturbed me. I had a feeling that she wished me away; that 
she did not understand me or my circumstances; that she was preju- 
diced against me, Diana and Mary appeared in the chamber once or 
twice a day. They would whisper sentences of this sort at my bedside— 

“Tt is very well we took her in.” 

“Ves; she would certainly have heen found dead at the door in the 
morning had she been left out all night. I wonder what she has gone 
through?” 

“Strange hardships, I imagine—poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?” 

“She ig not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of 
speaking—her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, 
though splashed and wet, were little worn and fine.” 

“She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like 
it; and when in goad health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy 
would be agreeable.” 

Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the 
hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of or aversion to 
myself. I was comforted. 

Mr. St. John came but once. He looked at me, and said my state of 
lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted fa- 
tigue. He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was 
sure, would manage best, left to herself. He said every nerve had been 
overstrained in some way, and ihe whole system must sleep torpid 
awhile. There was no discase. He imagined my recovery would be 
rapid enough when once commenced. These opinions he delivered in a 
few words, in a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in a tone of 
a man little accustomed to expansive comment, “Rather an unusual 
physiognomy; certainly not indicative of vulgarity or degradation.” 

“Far otherwise,” responded Diana. “To speak truth, St. John, my 
heart rather warms to the poor little soul. I wish we may be able to 
benefit her permanently.” 

“That is hardly likely,” was the reply. “You will find she is some 
young lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has 
probably injudiciously lefi them. We may, perhaps, succeed in restor- 
ing her to them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her 
face which make me sceptical of her tractability.” He stood consider- 
ing me some minutes; then added, “She looks sensible, but not at all 
handsome.” 

“She is so ill, St. John.” 

“Tl or well, she would always be plain. The grace and harmony of 
beauty are quite wanting in those features,” 

On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, 
tisc in bed, and turn. Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry 


JANE EYRE 293 


toast, about, as I supposed, the dinner-hour. I had eaten with relish: 
the food was good—void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto 
poisoned what I had swallowed. When she left me, I felt comparatively 
strong and revived: ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stir- 
red me. I wished to rise; but what could I put on? Only my damp and 
bemired apparel, in which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the 
marsh. I felt ashamed to appear before my benefactors so clad. I was 
spared the humiliation. 

On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry. My 
black silk frock hung against the wall. The traces of the bog were re- 
moved from il; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite 
decent. My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendcred pre- 
sentable. There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and 
brush to smooth my hair. After a weary process, and resting every five 
minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself. My clothes hung loose on me, 
for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl; and 
once more, clean and respectable looking—no speck of the dirt, no trace 
of the disorder I so hated, and which scemed so to degrade me, left—I 
crept down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow 
low passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen. 

Tt was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a gen- 
erous fire. Hannah was baking. Prejudices, it is well known, are most 
difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened 
or fertilized by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones. 
Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first; latterly she had be- 
gun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and well-dress- 
ed, she even smiled. 

“What, you have got up!” she said. “You are better, then? You 
may sit you down in my chair on the hearth-sione, if you will.” 

She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it. She bustled about, exam- 
ining me every now and then with the corner of her eye. Turning to 
me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly,— 

‘Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?” 

I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out 
of the question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I 
answered quictly, but still not without a certain marked firmness,-— 

“Vou are mistaken in supposing me a beggar. I am no beggar, any 
more than yourself or your young ladies.” 

After a pause she said, “I dunnut understand that: you've like no 
house, nor no brass, I guess?” 

“The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) 
does not make a beggar in your sense of the word.” 

“Are you book-learned?” she inquired prescntly. 


194 JANE EYRE 


“Yes, very.” 

“But you’ve never been to a boarding-school?” 

“T was at a boarding-school eight years.” 

She opened her eyes wide. “Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, 
then?” 

“T have kept myself, and, I trust, shall keep myself again. What are 
you going to do with these gooseberries?” I inquired, as she brought out 
a basket of the fruit, 

“Mak’ ’em into pies.” 

“Give them to me and I'll pick them.” 

“Nay; I dunnut want ye Lo do naught.” 

“But I must do something. Let me have them.” 

She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over 
my dregs, “lest,” as she said, “I should mucky it.” 

“Ye've not been used to sarvant’s wark, I see by your hands,” she re- 
marked. “Happen ye’ve been a dress-maker?” 

“No, you are wrong, And now, never mind what I have been 
don't trouble your head further about me—but tell me the name of the 
house where we are.” 

“Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House.” 

“And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?” 

“Nay; he doesn’t live here: he is only staying a while. When he is at 
home, he is in his own parish at Morton.” 

“That village a few miles off?” 

“ ‘Ay.” 

“And what. is he?” 

“Ee is a parson,” 

“T remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, 
when I had asked to see the clergyman. 

“This, then, was his father’s residence?” 

“Ay; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and 
qurt (great) grandfather afore him,” 

“The name, then, of that gentleman is Mr. St. John Rivers?” 

“Ay; St. John is like his kirstened name.” 

“And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?” 

Vas,” 

“Their father is dead?” 

“Dead three wecks sin’ of a stroke.” 

“They have no mother?” 

“The mistress has been dead this mony a year.” 

“Wave you lived with the family long?” 

“T’ve lived here thirty year. I nursed them all three.” 

“That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant. I 


JANE EYRE 205 


will say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a 
beggar.” 

She again regarded me with a surprised stare. “I believe,” she said, 
“T was quite mista’en in my thoughts of you; but there is so mony 
cheats goes about, you mun forgic me.” 

“And though,” I continued, rather severely, “you wished to turn me 
from the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog.” 

“Well, it was hard: but what can a body do? I thought more o’ th’ 
childer nor of mysel: poor things! They've like nobody to tak’ care on 
’em but me. I’m like to look sharpish.” 

I maintained a grave silence for some minutes. 

“Vou munnut think too hardly of me,” she again remarked. 

“But I do think hardly of you,” I said; “and I'll tell you why-—not 
so much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an 
impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that E 
had no ‘brass’ and no house. Some of the best people that ever lived 
have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought 
not to consider poverty a crime.” 

“No more I ought,” said she: “Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I 
see | wor wrang: but I’ve clear a different notion on you now to what I 
had. You look a raight down dacent little crater.” 

“That will do—I forgive you now. Shake hands.” 

She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier 
smile illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends. 

Hannah was evidently fond of talking. While I picked the fruit, and 
she made the paste for the pies, she procecded to give me sundry details 
about her deceased master and mistress, and “the childer,” as she called 
the young people. 

Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, 
and of as ancient a family as could be foynd. Marsh End had belonged 
to the Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, “aboon 
two hundred year old—for all it Jooked but a small, humble place, 
naught to compare wi’ Mr. Oliver’s grand hall down i’ Morton Vale. 
But she could remember Bill Oliver’s father a journeyman needle- 
maker; and th’ Rivers wor gentry i’ th’ owd days 0’ ih’ Henrys, as ony- 
body might see by looking into th’ registers i’ Morton Church vestry.” 
Still, she allowed, “ihe owd maister was like other folk—naught mich 
out o’ th’ common way: stark mad o’ shooting, and farming, and sich 
like.” The mistress was different. She was a great reader, and studied a 
deal; and ihe “bairns’ had taken after her. There was nothing like 
them in these parts, nor ever had been; they had liked learning, all 
three, almost from the time they could speak; and they had always 
been “of a mak’ of their own.” Mr. St. John, when he grew up, would 


296 JANE EYRE 


go to college and be a parson; and the girls, as soon as they left school, 
would seek places as governesses: for they had told her their father had 
some years ago lost a great deal of money by a man he had trusted turn- 
ing bankrupt; and as he was now not rich enough to give them for- 
tunes, they must provide for themselves, They had lived very li(tle at 
home for a long while, and were only come now to stay a few weeks on 
account of their father’s death; but they did so like Marsh End and 
Morton, and all these moors and hills about. They had been in London, 
and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no place 
like home. And then they were so agreeable with each other—never 
fell out nor “threaped.” She did not know where there was such a fam- 
ily for being united. 

Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the 
two ladies and their brother were now. 

“Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half 
an hour to tea,” 

They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they en- 
tered by the kitchen door. Mr, St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed 
and passed through; the two ladies stopped. Mary, in a few words, 
kindly and calmly expressed the pleasure she felt in secing me well 
enough {o be able to come down. Diana took my hand: she shook her 
head at me. 

“You should have waited for my leave to descend,” she said. “You 
still look very pale—and so thin! Poor child!—poor girl!” 

Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove. She 
possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter. Her whole face 
seemed to me full of charm, Mary’s countenance was cqually intelligent 
—her features equally pretty; but her expression was more reserved, 
and her manners, though gentle, more distant. Diana looked and spoke 
with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently, It was my nature to 
feel pleasure in yielding to an authorily supported like hers, and to bend, 
where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active will. 

“And what business have you here?” she continued. “It is not your 
place. Mary and I sil in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we 
like to be free, even to license—-but you are a visitor, and must go into 
the parlour.” 

“Tam very well here.” 

“Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour.” 

“Besides, the fire is too hot for you,” interposed Mary. 

“To be sure,” added her sister. “Come, you musi be obedient.” And 
still holding my hand, she made me rise, and led me into the inner room. 

“Sit there,” she said, placing me on the sofa, “while we take our 
things off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our 


JANE EYRE 207 


little moorland home—to prepare our own meals when we are so in- 
clined, or when Hannah, is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing.” 

She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat op- 
posite, a book or newspaper in his hand. I examined first the parlour, 
and then its occupant. 

The parlour was raLher a small room, very plainly furnished, yet com- 
fortable, because clean and neat. The old-fashioned chairs were very 
bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass. A few 
strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decor- 
ated the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some 
books and an ancient set of china. There was no superfluous ornament 
in the room—not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of work~« 
boxes and a lJady’s desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table: every- 
thing—including the carpet and curtains—looked at once well worn and 
well saved. 

Mr. St. John—sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls, 
keeping his cycs fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely sealed 
—was easy enough to examine. Had he been a statue instead of a man, 
he could not have been easicr. He was young—perhaps from twenty: 
eight to thirty—tall, slender, His face riveted the eye; it was like a 
Greek face, very pure in outline; quite a straight, classic nose; quite an 
Athenian mouth and chin. It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes 
so near the antique models as did his. He might well be a little shocked 
at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious. His 
eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead, colour- 
less as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of fair hair. 

This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader? Yet he whom it de- 
scribes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding, an 
impressible, or even of a placid nature. Quiescent as he now sat, there 
was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my per- 
ceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or eager. 
He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one glance, till 
his sisters returned. Diana, as she passed in and out, in the course of 
preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the Lop of the oven, 

“Hat that now,” she said; “you must be hungry. Hannah says you 
have had nothing but some gruel since breakfast.” 

I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen, Mr, Riv- 
ers now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, 
fixed his blue, pictorial-looking eyes full on me, There was an uncere~ 
monious directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, 
which told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted 
from the stranger. 

“You are very hungry,” he said. 


208 JANE EYRE 


“T am, sir.” It is my way—it always was my way, by inslinct--ever 
to meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness. 

“Tt is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the 
last three days; there would have been danger in yielding to the crav- 
ings of your appelite at first. Now you may eat, Lhough still not im- 
moderately.” 

“T trust I shall not cat long at your expense, sir,” was my very clum- 
sily-contrived, unpolished answer. 

“No,” he said coolly: “when you have indicated to us the residence of 
your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home,” 

“That, I must plainly tell you, is oul of my power to do, being ab- 
solutely without home and friends.” 

The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no 
suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosily, I speak particu- 
larly of the young ladies. St. John’s eyes, though clear enough in a 
literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom. He seemed to 
use them rather as instruments to search other people’s thoughts, than 
as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of kcenness and re- 
serve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than to encourage. 

“Do you mean to say,” he asked, “that you are completely isolated 
fram every connection?” 

“T do, Nota tie links me to any living thing; not a claim do I possesa 
to admittance under any roof in England.” 

“A most singular position at your age!” 

Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the 
table before me. I wondered what he sought there: his words soon ex- 
plained the quest. 

“Vou have never been married? You are a spinster?” 

Diana laughed, ‘Why, she can’t be above seventeen or eighteen years 
ald, St. John,” said she. 

“J am near nineteen, but I am not married. No.” 

I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating recol- 
lections were awakened by the allusion to marriage. They all saw the 
embarrassment and the emotion. Diana and Mary relieved me by turn- 
ing their eyes clsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder 
and sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited 
forced out tears as well as colour. 

“Where did you last reside?” he now asked, 

“You are too inquisilive, St, John,” murmured Mary in a low voice; 
but he leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm 
and piercing look. 

“The name of the place where and of the person with whom I lived is 
my secret,” I replied concisely. 


JANE EYRE 299 


“Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both 
from St. John and every other questioner,” remarked Diana. 

“Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help 
you,” he said. “And you need help, do you not?” 

“T need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will 
put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remunera~ 
tion for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessarics of life.” 

“T know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to 
aid you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest. First, then, 
tell me what you have becn accustomed to do, and what you caz do.” 

J had now swallowed my tea. I was mighlily refreshed by the bev- 
erage, as much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone (o my unstrung 
nerves, and enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily. 

“Mr, Rivers,” I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he lookea 
at me, openly and without diffidence, “you and your sisters have done 
me a great service—ihe greatest man can do his fellow-being: you have 
rescued me, by your noble hospitality, from death. This benefit con: 
ferred gives you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a 
certain extent, on my confidence. I will tell you as much of the history 
of the wanderer you have harboured as I can tell without compromising 
my own peace of mind—my own security, moral and physical, and that 
of others. 

“T am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman. My parents died be-~ 
fore I could know them. I was brought up a dependant; educated in a 
charitable institution. I will even tell you the name of the establish- 
ment, where I passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher~-Lowood 
Orphan Asylum, ——shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?— 
the Rev. Robert Brocklehurst is the treasurer.” 

“T have heard of Mr, Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school.” 

“T left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess, + 
obtained a good situation, and was happy. This place I was obliged to 
leave four days before I came here. The reason of my departure I can- 
not and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would 
sound incredible. No blame attached to me; I am as free from culpa- 
bility as any one of you three. Miserable I am, and must be for a time; 
for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a para- 
dise was of a strange and direful nature. J observed but two points in 
planning my departure—speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave 
behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel, which, in my 
hurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that 
brought me to Whitcross. To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite 
destitute. I slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two 
days without crossing a threshold; but twice in that space of time did I 


300 JANE EYRE 


taste food; and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair 
almost to the last gasp, thal you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of 
want at your door, and took me under the shelter of your roof. I know 
all your sisters have done for me since—for I have not been insensible 
during my seeming torpor—and I owe to their spontancous, genuine, 
genial compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity.” 

“Don’t make her talk any more now, St. John,” said Diana, as I 
paused; “she is evidently not yet fit for excitement. Come to the sofa 
and sit down now, Miss Elliott.” 

I gave an involuntary half-start at hearing the alias: I had forgotten 
my new name. Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it 
at once. 

“You said your name was Jane Elliott?” he observed. 

“TY did say so, and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be 
called at present; but it is nol my xeal name, and when I hear it it 
sounds strange to me.” 

“Your real name you will not give?” 

‘No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure 
would lead to it, I avoid.” 

“You are quite right, I am sure,” said Diana. “Now do, brother, let 
her be at peace a while.” 

But when St. John had mused a few moments, he recommenced as 
imperturbahly and with as much acumen as ever, 

“You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality—you 
would wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters’ com- 
passion, and, above all, with my charity (I am quite sensible of the dis- 
linclion drawn, nor do I resent it—il is just): you desire to be inde- 
pendent, of us?” 

“I do: I have already said so. Show me how to work, or how to seek 
work—that is all I now ask: then let me go, if it be but to the meanest 
cotiage; but till then, allow me to stay here. I dread another essay of 
the horrors of homeless destitution.” 

“Indeed you shall slay bere,” said Diana, putting her white hand on 
my head, “You shall,” repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative 
sincerity which seemed natural to her. 

“My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you,” said Mr. St. 
John, “as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half- 
frozen bird some wintry wind might have driven through their case- 
ment. J feel more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, 
and shall endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow. I am 
but the incumbent of a poor country parish; my aid must be of the 
humblest sort, And if you are inclined to despise the day of small 
things, seek some more efficient succour than such as I can offer.” 


JANE EYRE 308 


“She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can 
do,” answered Diana for me; “and you know, St. John, she has no 
choice of helper: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as 
you.” 

“I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain work-woman; I will be a 
servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better,” J answered. 

“Right,” said Mr. St. John, quite coolly. “If such is your spirit, I 
promise to aid you, in my own time and way.” 

He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before 
itea. I soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as 
my present strength would permit. 


CHAPTER XXX 


Tue more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked 
them. In a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit 
up all day, and walk out sometimes. I could join with Diana and Mary 
in all their occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, 
and aid them when and where they would allow me. There was a re- 
viving pleasure in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the 
first time—the pleasure arising from perfecl congeniality of tastes, sen- 
timents, and principles. 

I liked to read what they liked to read; what they enjoyed, delighted 
me; what they approved, I reverenced. They loved their sequestered 
home. I, too, in the gray, small, antique structure, with ils low roof, its 
latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs—all 
grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with 
yew and holly—and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would 
bloom—found a charm both potent and permanent. They clung to the 
purple moors behind and around their dwelling—to the hollow vale into 
which the pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and 
which wound between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of ‘the 
wildest little pasture fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or 
pave sustenance to a flock of gray moorland sheep, with their little 
mossy-faced lambs,—they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect en- 
thusiasm of attachment. I could comprehend the feeling, and share both 
its strength and truth. I saw the fascination of the locality. I felt the 
consecration of its loncliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell 
and sweep—on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by 
moss, by heath~bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and 
mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what they were to 
them——so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast 


302 JANE EYRE 


and the soft breeze; the rough and the halycon day; the hours of sun- 
rise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, 
in these regions, the same attraction as for them—wound round my 
faculties the same spell that entranced theirs. 

Indoors we agreed equally well. They were both more accomplished 
and better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of 
knowledge they had trodden before me. I devoured the books they lent 
me: then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening 
what I had perused during the day. Thought fitted thought; opinion 
met opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly. 

Tf in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana. Physi- 
cally, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous. In her 
animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow, such as 
excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension. I could talk a 
while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity and 
fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana’s feet, to rest my head 
on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they sounded 
thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched, Diana offered to teach 
me German. I liked to learn of her; I saw the part of instructress pleas- 
ed and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited me no less. Our 
natures dovetailed: mutual affection—of the strongest kind-—-was the 
result. They discovered I could draw: their pencils and colour-boxes 
were immediately at my service. My skill, greater in this one point than 
theirs, surprised and charmed them. Mary would sit and watch me by 
the hour together; then she would take lessons; and a docile, intelligent, 
assiduous pupil she made. Thus occupied, and mutually entertained, 
days passed like hours, and weeks like days. 

As to Mr. St. John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and 
rapidly between me and his sisters did not extend to him, One reason 
of the distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively 
seldom ai home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to 
visiting the sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish. 

No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain 
or fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his 
hat, and, followed by his father’s old poinicr, Carlo, go out on his mis- 
sion of love or duty—I scarcely know in which light he regarded it. 
Sometimes when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would ex- 
postulate. He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than 
cheerful,— 

“And if T let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain Lurn me aside from 
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I 
propose to myself?” 


JANE EYRE 303 


Diana and Mary’s general answer to this question was a sigh, and 
some minutes of apparently mournful meditation. 

But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to friend- 
ship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of a 
brooding nature, Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his life 
and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity, that 
inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere Christian 
and practical philanthropist. Often, of an evening, when he sat at the 
window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading or 
writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know not 
what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might be 
seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye. 

I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of de- 
light it was to his sisters, He expressed once, and but once, in my hear- 
ing, a strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn af- 
fection for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there 
was more of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the 
sentiment. was manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors 
for the sake of their soothing silence—never seek out or dwell upon the 
thousand peaceful delights they could yield. 

Incommunicative as he was, some time clapsed before I had an op- 
portunity of gauging his mind. I first got an idea of its calibre when I 
heard him preach in his own church at Morton. I wish I could describe 
that sermon, but it is past my power. I cannot even render faithfully 
the effect it produced on me. 

It began calm—and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, 
it was calm to the end, An earnestly felt yet strictly restrained zeal 
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous lan- 
guage. This grew to force—compressed, condensed, controlled. The 
heart was thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: 
neither was softened. Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an ab- 
sence of consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic doctrines 
—election, predestination, reprobation—were frequent; and each refer- 
ence to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom. 
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened 
by his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed 
to me—JI know not whether equally so to others—-that the eloquence to 
which I had been listening had sprung from a depth where Jay turbid 
dregs of disappointment—where moved troubling impulses of insatiate 
yearnings and disquieting aspirations, I was sure St. John Rivers— 
pure-lived, conscientious, zealous as he was—had not yet found that 
peace of God which passeth all understanding; he had no more found 
it, I thought, than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my 


304, JANE EYRE 


broken idol and lost elysium—regrets to which I have latterly avoided 
referring, but which possessed me and tyrannized over me ruthlessly. 

Meantime a month was gone. Diana and Mary were soon to leave 
Moor House, and return to the far different life and scene which await- 
ed them, as governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, 
where each held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty 
members they were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neith- 
er knew nor sought oul their innate excellences, and appreciated only 
their acquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their 
cook or the taste of their waiting-woman. Mr. St. John had said noth- 
ing to me yet about the employment he had promised to obtain for me; 
yet it became urgent that I should have a vocation of some kind. One 
morning, being left alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ven- 
tured lo approach the window-recess—which his table, chair, and desk 
consecrated as a kind of study—~and I was going to speak, though not 
very well knowing in what words to frame my inquiry—for it is at all 
times difficult to break the ice of reserve glassing over such natures as 
his~-when he saved me the trouble by being the first to commence a 
dialogue. 

Looking up as I drew near—“You have a question to ask of me?” he 
said. 

“Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can 
offer myself to undertake?” 

“T found or devised something for you threc weeks ago; but as you 
fcemed both useful and happy here—as my sisters had evidently be- 
come attached to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure~—I 
deemed it inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their 
approaching departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary.” 

“And they will go in three days now?” I said. 

“Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton; 
Hannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up.” 

I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject 
first broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflec- 
tion; his look denoted abstraction from me and my business. I was 
obliged to recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and 
anxious interest to me. 

“What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers? I hope this 
delay will not have increased the difficulty of securing it.” 

“Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, 
and you to accept.” 

He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue. I grew im- 
patient: a résiless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance 


JANE EYRE 305 


fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words 
could have done, and with less trouble. 

“You need be in no hurry to hear,” he said: “Jet me frankly tell you, 
J have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest. Before I explain, recall, 
if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it must be 
as the blind man would help the lame. I am poor; for I find that, when 
T have paid my father’s debts, all the patrimony remaining to me will be 
this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the patch of 
moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front. I am obscure, 
Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of the race, 
two earn the dependant’s crust among strangers, and the third considers 
himself an alien from his native country—not only for life, but in 
death. Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by the 
lot, and aspires but after tne day when the cross of separation from 
fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that 
church militant of whose humblest members he jis one, shall give the 
word, ‘Rise, fallow Me!’” 

St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons—with a quiet, 
deep voice, with an unflushed check, and a coruscating radiance of 
glance. He resumed :— 

“And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a serv- 
ice of poverty and obscurity. You may even think it degrading—for I 
see now your habits have been what the world calls refined; your tastes 
lean to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the edu- 
cated—but / consider that no service degrades which can better our 
race. I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the 
Christian Jabourer’s task of tillage is appointed him—the scantier the 
meed his toil brings—the higher the honour. His, under such circum- 
stances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gos- 
pel were the Apostles—their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer Himself.” 

“Well?” I said, as he again paused—‘‘proceed.” 

He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to 
read my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page, The 
conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his suc- 
ceeding observations. 

“T believe you will accept the post I offer you,” said he, “and hold it 
for a while: not permanently, though, any more than I could perma- 
nently keep the narrow and narrowing, the tranquil, hidden office of 
English country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detriment- 
al to repose as that in mine, though of a different kind.” 

“Do explain,” I urged, when he halted once more. 

“I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is—how trivial— 
how cramping. I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is 


306 JANE EYRE 


dead, and that Iam my own master. I shall leave the place probably in 
the course of a twelvemonth; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to 
the ulmost for its improvement. Morton, when I came to it two years 
aga, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every 
hope of progress I established one for boys: I mean now to open a 
second school for girls. I have hired a building for the purpose, with a 
cottage of two rooms allached to it for the mistress’s house. Her salary 
will be thirty pounds a year. Her house is already furnished, very 
simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver, the only 
daughter of the sole rich man in my parish—-Mr. Oliver, the proprietor 
of a needle-factory and iron-foundry in the valley. The same lady pays 
for the education and clothing of an orphan from the work-house, 
on condition that she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices con- 
nected with her own house and the school as her occupation of teaching 
will prevent her having Lime to discharge in person, Will you be this 
mistress?” 

He put the question rather hurriedly. He scemed half to expect an 
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer; not knowing all 
my thoughts and feclings, though guessing some, he could not tell in 
what light the lot would appear to me. In truth it was humble—but 
then il was shellered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding— 
but then, compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was inde- 
pendent; and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like 
jron: it was not ignoble—not unworthy—not mentally degrading. I 
made my decision. 

“I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all 
my heart.” 

“But you comprehend me?” he said. “It is a village school; your 
scholars will be only poor girls—cottagers’ children-—~at the best, farm- 
ers’ daughters. Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all 
you will have to teach. What will you do with your accomplishments? 
What with the largest portion of your mind—sentiments—tastes?” 

“Save them till they are wanted. They will keep.” 

“Vou know what you undertake, then?” 

“T do. 

He now smiled; and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased 
and deeply gratified, 

“And when will you commence the exercise of your function?" 

“T will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, 
next weck.” 

‘Very well: so be it,” 

He rose and walked through the room, Standing still, he again looked 
at me. He shook his head. 


JANE EYRu 307 


“What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?” I asked, 

“You will not stay at Morton long—no, no!” 

“Why? What is your reason for saying so?” 

“T read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the 
maintenance of an even tenor in life.” 

“T am not ambitious.” 

He started at the word “ambitious.” He repeated, “No. What made 
you think of ambition? Who is ambitious? I know I am; but how did 
you find it out?” 

“T was speaking of myself.” 

“Well, if you are not ambitious, you are 

“What” 

“T was going to say, impassioned; but perhaps you would have mis- 
understood the word, and becn displeased, I mean, that human affec- 
tions and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you. I am sure you 
cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to devote 
your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus; 
any more than I can be content,” he added, with emphasis, ‘“‘to live here 
buried in morass, pent in with mountains—my nature, that God gave 
me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralyzed—made use- 
less, You hear now how I contradict myself. I, who preached content- 
ment with a humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of 
wood and drawers of water in God’s service—~I, His ordained minister, 
almost rave in my restlessness. Well, propensities and principles must 
be reconciled by some means.” 

He left the room, In this brief hour I had learned more of him thar 
in the whole previous month; yct still he puzzled me. 

Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day ap- 
proached for leaving their brother and their home. They both tried to 
appear as usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one 
that could not be untirely conquered or concealed. Diana intimated that 
this would be a different parting from any they had ever yet known. It 
would probably, as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years 
—it might be a parting for life. 

“Ye will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves,” she said: “natural 
affection, and feelings more potent still, St. John looks quiet, Jane; but 
he hides a fever in his vitals. You would think him gentle, yet in some 
things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my conscience 
will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe decision: cer- 
tainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it, It is right, noble, 
Christian; yet it breaks my heart!” And the tears gushed to her fine 
eyes, Mary bent her head low over her work, 


” He paused. 


308 JANE EYRE 


“We are now without father; we shall soon be without home and 
brother,” she murmured. 

At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed 
by fate purposely to prove the truth of the adage that “misfortunes 
never come singly,” and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the 
slip belween the cup and the lip. St. John passed the window reading a 
letter. He entered. 

“Our uncle John is dead,” said he. 

Both the sisters seemed struck—not shocked or appalled; the tidings 
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting. 

“Dead?” repeated Diana. 

“Ves,” 

She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face. “And what then?” 
she demanded, in a low voice. 

“What then, Die?” he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of 
feature. “What then? Why—nothing, Read.” 

He threw the Ietter into her lap. She glanced over it, and handed it to 
Mary. Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother. All 
three looked at cach other, and all three smiled—a dreary, pensive smile 
enough, 

“Amen! We can yet live,” said Diana at last. 

“AL any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before,” re- 
marked Mary, 

“Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what micht 
have been,’ said Mr. Rivers, “and contrasts it somewhat too vividly 
with what is.” 

He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out. 

For some minutes no one spoke. Diana then turned to me. 

“Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries,” she said, “and think 
us hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a 
relation as an uncie; but we have never seen him or known him, [He was 
my mother’s brother, My father and he quarrelled long ago, IL was by 
his advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation 
that ruined him, Mutual recrimination passed between them: they 
parted in anger, and were never reconciled. My uncle engaged after- 
wards in more prosperous undetlakings: il appears he realized a for- 
tune of twenty thousand pounds, He was never married, and had no 
near kindred but ourselves and one other person, not more closely re- 
lated than we. My father always cherished the idea that he would atone 
for his error by leaving his possessions to us. That letter informs us that 
he has bequeathed every penny Lo the other relation, with the exception 
of thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary 
Rivers, for the purchase of three mourning rings, He had a right, of 


JANE EYRE 309 


course, to do as he pleased; and yct a momentary damp is cast on the 
spirits by the receipt of such news, Mary and I would have esleemed 
ourselves rich with a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum 
would have been valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to 
do.” 

This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further refer- 
ence made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters. The next day I left 
Marsh End for Morton. The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for 
distanL B——. In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the par: 
sonage; and so the old grange was abandoned. 


CHAPTER XXXI 


My home, then—when I at last find a home—is a cottage; a little room 
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted 
chairs and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and 
dishes, and a set of tea-things in delf. Above, a chamber of the same 
dimensions as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead, and chest of drawers, 
smali, yet too large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe; though the 
kindness of my gentle and generous friends has increased thal, by a 
modest stock of such things as are necessary. 

It is evening. I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little 
orphan who serves me as a handmaid. I am sitting alone on the hearth, 
This morning, the village school opened. I had twenty scholars, But 
three of the number could read—none write or cipher. Several knit, and 
a few sew a little. They speak with the broadest accent of the district, 
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's 
language. Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as 
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a dis- 
position that pleases me. I must not forget that these coarsely-clad 
little peasants axe of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest 
genealogy; and that the germs of native exccllence, refinement, intelli- 
gence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in those of the 
best-born. My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I shall find 
some happiness in discharging that office. Much enjoyment I do not ex- 
pect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if IT regulate my 
mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live on from 
day to day. 

Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in 
yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon? Not to 
deceive myself, I must reply—No: I felt desolate to a degree. I felt— 
yes, idiot that I am—-I felt degraded. I doubted I had taken a step 


310 JANE EYRE 


which sunk instead of raising me in the scale of social existence. I was 
weakiy dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I 
heard and saw round me. But let me not hate and despise myself too 
much for these feelings. I know them to be wrong: that is a great step 
gained; I shall strive to overcome them. To-morrow, I trust, I shall get 
the better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be 
quite subdued. In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing 
progress, and a change for the better in my scholars, may substitute 
gratification for disgust. 

Meantime, Ict me ask myself one question—~Which is better?-—To 
have surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful 
effort—~no struggle;—but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen 
asleep on the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst 
the luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr, 
Rochester’s mistress; delirious with his love half my time—for he would 
—oh yes, he would have loved me well for a while, He did love me—no 
one will ever love me sa again. I shall never more know the sweet 
homage given Lo beauty, youth, and grace—for never to any one else 
shall I seem to possess these charms. He was fond and proud of me; it 
is what no man besides will ever be-—But where am I wandering, and 
what am I saying, and, above all, feeling? Whether it is better, I ask, 
to be a slave in a fool’s paradise al Marscilles—fevered with delusive 
bliss one hour~—suffocaling with the bitterest tears of remorse and 
shame the next—or to be a village schoolmistress, free and honest, in a 
breezy mountain nook in the healthy heart of England? 

Yes; I fecl now thal T was right when I adhered Lo principle and law, 
and scorned and crushed the insane promptines of a frenzied moment. 
God directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the 
guidance! 

Having brought my eventide musings Lo this point, I rose, went to my 
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quict fields 
before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile from 
the village. The birds were singing their last strains— 


“The air was mild, the dew was balm.” 


While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find my- 
self ere long weeping—and why? For the doom which had reft me from 
adhesion to my master; for him I was no more to see; for the desperate 
gricf and fatal fury—consequences of my departure—which might now, 
perhaps, be dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope 
of ultimate restoration thither, At this thought, I turned my face aside 
from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton—I say lonely, for 
in that bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the 


JANE EYRE 311 


church and the parsonage, half hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, 
the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr, Oliver and his daughter lived. 
I hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; 
but soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden 
from the mcadow beyond it made me look up. A dog—old Carlo, Mr. 
Rivers’s pointer, as I saw in a moment—was pushing the gate with his 
nose, and St. John himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow 
knit, his gaze, grave almost to displeasure, fixed on me. I asked him to 
come in, 

“No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters 
left for you. I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper.” 

T approached to take it: a welcome gift it was. He cxamined my face, 
J thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were doubt- 
less very visible upon it. 

“Have you found your first day’s work harder than you expected?” 
he asked. 

“Oh no! On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my 
scholars very well,” 

“But perhaps your accommodations—your cottage—your furniture 
have disappointed your expectations? They are, in truth, scanty 
enough; but———” I interrupted,— 

“My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and 
commodious. All I sec has made me thankful, not despondent. I am not 
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a car- 
pet, a sofa, and silver plate. Besides, five weeks ago I had nothing—I 
was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, 
a business. I wonder at the goodness of God, the generosity of my 
friends, the bounty of my lot. I do not repine.” 

“But you feel solitude an oppression? The little house there behind 
you is dark and empty.” 

“T have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less 
to grow impatient under one of loneliness.” 

“Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, 
your good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the 
vacillating fears of Lot’s wife, What you had left before I saw you, of 
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every tempta- 
tion which would incline you to look back. Pursue your present career 
steadily, for some months at least.” 

“Tt is what I mean to do,” I answered, St. John continued,— 

“Tt is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the 
bent of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience. God 
has given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when 
our energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get—when our 


3r2 JANE EYRE 


will strains after a path we may not follow—we need neither starve 
from inanition nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another 
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to 
taste—and perhaps purer; to hew out for the adventurous foot a 
road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, 
if rougher than it. 

“A year ago I was myself intenscly miserable, because J thought I had 
made a mislake in entering the minislry: its uniform duties wearied me 
to death. I burned for the more active life of the world—for the more 
exciling toils of a literary career—for the destiny of an artist, author, 
orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of a poli- 
tician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a luster after 
power, heat under my curate’s surplice. I considered: my life was so 
wretched, it musl he changed, or I must die, Aftcr a season of darkness 
and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped existence all at 
once spread out to a plain without bounds—my powers heard a call from 
Heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread their wings, and mount 
beyond ken. God had an errand for me; to bear which afar, to deliver 
it well, skill and strength, courage and eloquence, the best qualifications 
of soldier, statesman, and orator, were all needed: for these all centre in 
the good missionary. 

“A missionary I resolved to be. From that moment my state of mind 
changed; the felters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving 
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness—which time only can heal. 
My father, indeed, opposed the determination; but since his death I 
have not a legitimate obstacle to contend with, Some affairs settled, a 
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings 
broken through or cut asunder—a last conflict with hurnan weakness, in 
which I know J shall overcome, because I have vowed that I will over- 
come—and I leave Europe for the East,” 

He said this in his peculiar, subdued, yel emphatic voice; looking, 
when he had ceased speaking, not al me, but at the setting sun, at which 
T looked too. Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up 
the ficld to the wicket, We had heard no step on that grass-grown Lrack; 
the water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and 
scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell, 
exclaimed — 

“Good-evening, Mr. Rivers. And good-evening, old Carlo. Your dog 
is quicker to recognize his friends than you are, sir. He pricked his ears 
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have 
your back Lowards me now.” 

Tt was true. Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those 
musical accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he 


JANE EYRE 313 


stood yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the 
speaker had surprised him—his arm resting on the gate, his face directed 
towards the west. He turned at last, with measured deliberation. A 
vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side. There appeared, within 
three fect of him, a form clad in pure white—a youthful, graceful form: 
full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo, it 
lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under his 
glance a face of perfect beauty. Perfect beauty is a strong expression; 
but I do not retract or qualify it: as sweet features as ever the tem- 
perate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as ever 
her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified, in 
this instance, the term. No charm was wanting, no defect was per 
ceptible: the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eves 
shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark, 
and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with 
so soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the 
white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties 
of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too, 
ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without 
flaw; the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses— 
all advantages, in short, which, combined, realize the ideal of beauty, 
were fully hers. I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired 
her with my whole heart. Nature had surely formed hei in a partial 
raood; and, forgetting her usual stinted stepmother dole of gifts, had 
endowed this, her darling, with a grand-dame’s bounty. 

What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel? I naturally 
asked myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; 
and, as naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance, 
He had already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a 
humble tuft of daisies which grew by the wicket. 

“A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone,” he said, as he 
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot. 

“Oh, I only came home from S——” (she mentioned the name of a 
large town some twenty miles distant) “this afternoon, Papa told me 
you had opened your school, and that the new mistress was come; and 
so I put on my bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her—this is 
she?” pointing to me. 

“Tt is,” said St. John. 

“Do you think you shall like Morton?” she asked of me, with a direct 
and naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if childlike. 

“T hope I shall, I have many inducements to do so,” 

“Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?” 

“Quite.” 


314 JANE EYRE 


“Do you like your house?” 

“Very much.” 

“Have I furnished it nicely?” 

“Very nicely, indeed.” 

“And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?” 

“Vou have indeed. She is teachable and handy.” (This then, I 
thought, is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of 
fortune, as well as in those of nature! What happy combination of the 
planets presided over her birth, I wonder?) 

“T shall come up and help you to Leach sometimes,” she added. “It 
will be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change. 
Mr, Rivers, I have been so gay during my stay at S——~. Last night, or 
rather this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock, The —th Regiment 
are stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agree- 
able men in the world. They put all our young knife-grinders and scissor 
merchants to shame.” 

It seemed to me that Mr, St. John’s under Jip protruded, and his up- 
per lip curled a moment. His mouth certainly looked a good deal com- 
pressed, and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as 
the laughing girl gave him this information. He lifted his gaze, too, 
from the daisies, and turned it on her. An unsmiling, a searching, a 
meaning gaze it was. She answered it with a second laugh; and laughter 
well became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes. 

As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo. “Poor 
Carlo loves me,” said she. “Ae is not stern and distant to his friends; 
and if he could speak, he would not be silent.” 

As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his 
young and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master’s face. I saw 
his solemn cye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion. 
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she 
for a woman. His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of 
despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a vig- 
orous bound for the attainment of liberty. But he curbed it, I think, as 
a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed. He responded neither by 
word nor movement to the gentle advances made him. 

“Papa says you never come to see us now,” continued Miss Oliver, 
looking up. “You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall. He is alone this 
evening, and not very well; will you return with me and visit him?” 

; “Tt is not a scasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver,” answered St. 
obn. 

“Not a seasonable hour! But I declare it is. It is just the hour when 
papa most wants company-—-when the works are closed, and he has no 
business to occupy him. Now, Mr. Rivers, do come. Why are you so 


JANE EYRE 315 


very shy and so very sombre?” She filled up the hiatus his silence left 
by a reply of her own. 

“I forgot!” she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful, curled head, as if 
shocked at herself. “I am so giddy and thoughtless. Do excuse me. It 
had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for 
joining in my chatter. Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House 
js shut up, and you are so Jonely. I am sure I pity you. Do come and 
see papa.” 

“Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night.” 

Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the 
effort iL cost him thus to refuse. 

“Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay 
any longer—the dew begins to fall. Good-evening!” 

She held out her hand. He just touched it. “Good-evening!” he re- 
peated, in a voice low and hollow as an echo. She turned, but in a mo- 
ment returned. 

“Are you well?” she asked. Well might she put the question: his face 
was blanched as her gown. 

“Quite well,” he enunciated; and with a bow he left the gate. She 
went one way; he another. She turned twice to gaze after him as she 
tripped fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never 
turned at all. 

This spectacle of another’s suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts 
from exclusive meditation on my own. Diana Rivers had designated her 
brother “inexorable as death.” She had not exaggerated. 


CHAPTER XXXII 


I continuep the labours of the village school as actively and faithfully 
as I could. It was truly hard work at first. Some time elapsed before, 
with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature. 
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me hope~ 
lessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike. But I soon found I was 
mistaken, There was a difference amongst them, as amongst the edu- 
cated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference rap- 
idly developed itself. Their amazement at me, my language, my rules, 
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping 
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough. Many showed them- 
selves obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a 
few examples of natural politeness and innate self-respect, as well as of 
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration. 
These soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their 


316 JANE EYRE 


persons neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and 
orderly manners. The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was 
even surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it. Besides, I 
began personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me. I had 
amongst my scholars several farmers’ daughters—young women grown, 
almost. These could already read, write, and sew; and to them IJ taught 
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of 
needlework. I found estimable characters amongst them——characters 
desirous of information and disposed for improvement—with whom I 
passed many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes. Their parents 
then (the farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions. There was an 
enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a 
consideration—a scrupulous regard to their feelings—to which they 
were not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed 
and benefited them, because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, 
it made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received. 

I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood. Whenever I went 
out, I heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with 
friendly smiles, To live amidst general regard, though it be but the re- 
gard of working people, is like “sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;” 
serene inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray, Al this period of 
my life, my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with 
dejection; and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this 
useful existence—after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my 
scholars, an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone—I 
used to rush into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agi- 
tated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the stormy—dreams where, amidst 
unusual scenes charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic 
chance, I still again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some ex- 
citing crisis; and then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, 
meeting his eye, touching his hand and check, loving him, being loved by 
him—the hope of passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with 
all its first force and fire. Then I awoke. Then I recalled where I was, 
and how situated, Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and 
quivering; and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of 
despair, and heard the burst of passion, By nine o’clock the next morn- 
ing I was punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for 
the steady duties of the day. 

Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me. Her call at the 
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride, She would 
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery ser- 
vant. Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, 
with her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long 


JANE EYRE 317 


curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be 
imagined; and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide 
through the dazzled ranks of the village children. She generally came at 
the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechizing 
lesson. Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young 
pastor’s heart. A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance, 
even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from 
the door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble- 
seeming features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, 
and in their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, 
stronger than working muscle or darting glance could indicate. 

Of course, she knew her power; indeed, he did not, because he could 
not, conceal it from her. In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she 
went up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fond- 
ly in his face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn. He seemed to 
say, with his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, “I 
love you, and I know you prefer me, It is not despair of success that 
keeps me dumb. If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it. 
But that heart is already laid on a sacred altar; the fire is arranged 
round it. It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed.” 

And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud 
would soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily 
from his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so 
heroic and so martyr-like. St. John, no doubt, would have given the 
world to follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him: but he would 
not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her 
love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise. Besides, he could not bind 
all that he had in his nature—the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest 
—in the limits of a single passion. He could not—he would not—re- 
nounce his wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace 
of Vale Hall. I learned so much from himself in an inroad I once, 
despite his reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence. 

Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage. 
I had learned her whole character, which was without mystery or dis- 
guise: she was coquettish, but not heartless; exacting, but not worth- 
lessly selfish. She had been indulged from her birth, but was not abso- 
lutely spoilt. She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not 
help it, when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of love- 
liness), but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of 
wealth; ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: 
she was very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex 
like me; but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impres- 
sive, A very different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of 


318 JANE EYRE 


the sisters af St. John. Still, I tiked her almost as I liked my pupil 
Adéle; except that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, 
a closer affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive 
adult acquaintance. 

She had taken an amiable caprice to me. She said I was like Mr. 
Rivers, only, cerlainly, she allowed, “not one-tenth so handsome, though 
T was a nice, neat little soul enough, but he was an angel.” I was how- 
ever, good, clever, composed, and firm, like him. I was a lusus nature, 
she affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous his- 
tory, if known, would make a delightful romance. 

One evening, while, wilh her usual childlike activity, and thoughtless 
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and 
the table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French 
books, a volume of Schiller, 2 German grammar and dictionary, and 
then my drawing maierials and some sketches, including a pencil-head 
of a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views 
from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors. 
She was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight. 

“Fad I done these pictures? Did I know French and German? What. 
a love—what a miracle I was! I drew better than her master in the 
first school in S———~. Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to 
papaP” 

“With pleasure,” I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist delight at the 
idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model. She had then ona 
dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only orna- 
ment was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all 
the wild grace of natural curls. I took a sheet of fine cardboard, and 
drew a careful outline. I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; 
and, as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit an- 
other day. 

She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself 
accompanied her next cvening—a tall, maassive-featured, middle-aged, 
and gray-headed man, al whose side his lovely daughter looked like a 
bright flower near a hoary (urret, He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps 
a proud personage; but he was very kind to me, The sketch of Rosa- 
mond’s portrait pleased him highly; be said I must make a finished pic- 
ture of it. He insisted, too, on my coming next day to spend the eve- 
ning at. Vale Fall, 

I went. I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant evi- 
dences of wealth in the proprictor. Rosamond was full of glee and 
pleasure all the time I stayed. Her father was affable; and when he en- 
tered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms 
his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he only 


JANE EYRE 319 


feared, from what he saw and heard, f was too good for the place, and 
would soon quit it for one more suitable. 

“Indeed,” cried Rosamond, “she is clever enough to be a governess in 
a high family, papa.” 

I thought, I would far rather be where 1 am than in any high family 
in the land. Mr, Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers—of the Rivers family— 
with great respect. He said it was a very old name in that neighbour- 
hood; that the ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton 
had once belonged to them; that even now he considered the represen- 
tative of that house might, if he liked, make an alliance with the best. 
He accounted it a pity that so fine and talented a young man should 
have formed the design of going out as a missionary; ic was quile throw- 
ing a valuable life away. It appeared, then, that her father would throw 
no obstacle in the way of Rosamond’s union with St. John, Mr, Oliver 
evidently regarded the young clergyman’s good birth, old name, and 
sacred profession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune. 

It was the sth of November, and a holiday. My little servant, after 
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a 
penny for her aid. All about me was spotless and bright—scoured floor, 
polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs. I had also made myself neat, 
and had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would. 

The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I 
got my palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier 
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature. The head was 
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery 
to shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips——a soft curl 
here and there to the tresses—a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash 
under the azured eyelid. I was absorbed in the execution of these nice 
details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John 
Rivers. 

“I am come te see how you are spending your holiday,” he said. 
“Not, I hope, in thought? No, that is well; while you draw you will not 
feel lonely. You see I mistrust you still, though you have borne up 
wonderfully so far, I have brought you a book for evening solace,” and 
he laid on the table a new publication—a poem: one of those genuine 
productions so offen vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days, 
the golden age of modern literature. Alas! the readers of our era are Jess 
favoured. But courage! I will not pause either to accuse or repine, I 
know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained pow~ 
er over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence, 
their presence, their liberly and strength again one day. Powerful angels, 
safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph and feeble ones 
weep over their destruction, Poetry destroyed? Genius banished? No! 


320 JANE EYRE 


Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought. No; they 
not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence 
spread everywhere, you would be in hell—the hell of your own mean- 
ness. 

While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of Marmion (for 
Marmion it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing. His tall 
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing. I looked up at 
him: he shunned my eye. I knew his thoughts well, and could read his 
heart. plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he. I had 
then temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination 
to do him some good, if I could. 

“With all his firmness and self-control,” thought I, “he tasks himself 
too far—locks every fecling and pang within—expresses, confesses, im- 
parts nothing. J am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about this 
swect Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make 
him talk,” 

T said first, “Take a chair, Mr. Rivers.” But he answered, as he al- 
ways did, that he could not stay. “Very well,” I responded, mentally, 
“stand if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: 
solitude is at least as bad for you as it is for me. I'll try if I cannot 
discover the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in 
that marble breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of 
sympathy.” 

“Is this portrait like?” I asked bluntly, 

“Like! Like whom? I did not observe it closely.” 

“You did, Mr. Rivers.” 

He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he loaked 
at me astonished. “Oh, that is nothing yet,” I muttered within. “I don’t 
mean to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I’m prepared to go 
to considerable lengths.” I continued, “You observed it closely and 
distinctly; but I Lave no objection to your looking at it again,” and I 
rose and placed it in his hand. 

“A well-executed picture,” he said; “very soft, clear colouring; very 
graceful and correct drawing.” 

“Ves, yes; I know all that. But what of the resemblance? Who is it 
like?” ; 

Mastering some hesitation, he answered, “Miss Oliver, I presume.” 

“Qf cousse, And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will 
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very pic- 
ture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you. I 
don’t wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would 
deem worthless.” 

He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer 


JANE EYRE 321 


he held it, the more he seemed to covet it. “It is like!” he murmured: 
“the eye is well managed; the colour, light, expression, are perfect. It 
smiles!” 

“Would it comfort or would it wound you to have a similar painting? 
Tell me that. When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in 
India, would it be a consolation to have that memento in your posses- 
sion? or would the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate 
and distress?” 

He now furlively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute, dis- 
turbed: he again surveyed the picture. 

“That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious 
or wise is another question!” 

Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and 
that her father was not likely to oppose the match, J—less exalted in my 
views than St. John—had been strongly disposed in my own heart to 
advocate their union. It seemed to me that, should he become the 
possessor of Mr. Oliver’s large fortune, he might do as much good with 
it as if he went and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to 
waste, under a tropical sun. With this persuasion I now answered, 

“As far as 1 can sce, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were 
to take to yourself the original at once.” 

By this time he had sat down. He had laid the picture on the table 
before bim, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly 
over it. I discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my 
audacity. I saw even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he 
had deemed unapproachable—to hear it thus freely handled—was be- 
ginning to be felt by him as a new pleasure, an unhoped-for relief. Re- 
served people often really need the frank discussion of their sentiments 
and griefs more than the expansive. The sternest-seeming stoic is hu- 
man after all; and to “burst” with boldness and good-will into “the 
silent sea” of their souls is often to confer on them the first of obliga- 
tions. 

“She likes you, I am sure,” said I, as I stood behind his chair, “and 
her father respects you. Moreover, she is a swect girl—rather thought~ 
less; bul you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her, 
You ought Lo marry her.” 

“Does she like me?” he asked. 

“Certainly; better than she likes any one else. She talks of you con- 
tinually; there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so 
, often,” 

“Tt is very pleasant to hear this,’ he said—‘‘very: go on for another 
quarter of an hour.” And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon 
the table to measure the time. 


322 JANE EYRE 


“But where is the use of going on,” I asked, “when you are probably 
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to 
fetter your heartP” 

“Don’l imagine such hard things. Fancy me yielding and melting, as 
I am doing: human Jove rising like a freshly-opened fountain in my 
mind and overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so care- 
fully and with such labour prepared—so assiduously sown wilh the 
seeds of good intentions, of self-denying plans. And now it is deluged 
with a nectarous floed—the young germs swamped—delicious poison 
cankering them: now I sce myself stretched on an oltoman in the draw- 
ing-room at Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's fect. She is talk. 
ing to me with her sweet voice—gazing down on me with those eyes 
your skilful hand has copied so well—smiling at me with these coral 
lips. She is mine—I am hers—this present life and passing world suf- 
fice to me. Hush! say nothing——my heart is full of delight—my senses 
are entranced—let the time I marked pass in peace,” 

I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I 
stood silent. Amidst this hush the quarter sped; he replaced the watch, 
laid the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth, 

“Now,” said he, “that little space was given to delirium and delusion, 
T rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck vol- 
untarily under her yoke of flowers; I tasted her cup. ‘The pillow was 
burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her 
promises are hollow—~her offers false. I see and know all this.” 

T gazed at him in wonder. 

“Tt is strange,” pursued he, “that while I love Rosamond Oliver so 
wildly—with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of 
which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, and fascinating~I experience at 
the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make 
me a good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should 
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months’ 
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret. This I know.” 

“Strange indeed!” I could not help ejaculating. 

“While something in me,” he went on, “is acutely sensible to her 
charms, something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are 
such that she could sympathize in nothing I aspired to, co-operate in 
nothing I undertook. Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle? 
Rosamond a missionary’s wife? No!” 

“But you need not be a missionary. You might relinquish that 
scheme.” 

“Relinquish! What! my vocation? My great work? My founda- 
tion laid on carth for a mansion in heaven? My hopes of being num- 
bered in the band who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of 


JANE EYRE 323 


bettering their race—of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignor- 
ance—of substituting peace for war, freedom for bondage, religion for 
superstition, the hope of heaven for the fear of hell? Must I relinquish 
that? It is dearer than the blood in my veins. It is what I have to look 
forward to, and to live for.” 

After a considerable pause, I said—‘‘And Miss Oliver? Are her dis- 
appointment and sorrow of no interest to you?” 

“Miss Oliver is cver surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than 
a month my image will be effaced from her heart. She will forget me; 
and will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than 
T should do.” 

“Vou speak coolly enough, but you suffer in the conflict. You are 
wasting away.” 

“No. If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet 
unsettled—my departure, continually procrastinated. Only this morn- 
ing I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been 
so long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to 
come yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six.” 

“Vou tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the 
schoolroom.” 

Again the surprised expression crossed his face. He had not im. 
agined that a woman would dare to speak so to a man. For me, I felt 
at home in this sort of discourse. I could never rest in communication 
with strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I 
had passed the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the thres- 
hold of confidence, and won a place by their heart’s very hearthstone. 

“Vou are original,” said he, “and not timid. There is something brave 
in your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure 
you that you partially misinterpret my emotions, You think them more 
profound and potent than they are. You give me a larger allowance of 
sympathy than I have a just claim to. When I colour and when I shake 
before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself. I scorn the weakness, I know 
it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh; not, I declare, the convulsion ot 
the soul. Thaé is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths of a rest. 
less sea, Know me to be what I am—a cold, hard man.” 

I smiled incredulously. 

“You have taken my confidence by storm,” he continued, “and now it 
is much at your service, I am simply, in my original state—stripped of 
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deform.~ 
ity—a cold, hard, ambitious man, Natural affection only, of all the sen- 
timents, has permanent power over me, Reason, and not feeling, is my 
guide; my ambition is unlimited—my desire to rise higher, to do more 
than others, insatiable. I honour endurance, perseverance, industry, 


324 JANE EYRE 


talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends 
and mount to lofty eminence. I watch your carcer with interest, because 
I consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not 
because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what 
you still suffer.” 

“Vou would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher,” I said, 

“No. There is this difference betwecn me and deistic philosophers: I 
believe; and I belicve the Gospel. You missed your epithet. I am nota 
pagan, but a Christian philosopher—a follower of the sect of Jesus. As 
His disciple I adopt His pure, Wis merciful, His benignant doctrines. I 
advocate them; I am sworn to spread them Won in youth to religion, 
she has cullivated my original qualities thus:—-F'rom the minute germ 
natural affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philan- 
thropy. From the wild, stringy root of human uprightness she has 
reared a duc sense of the Divine justice. Of the ambition to win power 
and renown for my wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread 
my Master’s kingdom—to achieve victories for the standard of the 
cross. So much has religion done for me—turning the original materials 
to the best account; pruning and training nature. But she could not 
eradicate nature; nor will it be eradicated ‘till this mortal shall put on 
immortality.’ ” 

Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my 
palette. Once more he looked at the portrait. 

“She is lovely!” he murmured. “She is well named the Rose of the 
world, indeed!” 

“And may I not paint one like it for your” 

“Cui bono? No.” 

He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was ac- 
customed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from 
being sullicd. What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was im- 
possible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye, Me took it up 
with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me, inex- 
pressibly peculiar and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed to 
take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it 
traversed all, quick, keen as lightning. His lips parted, as if to speak; 
bul he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was. 

“What is the matter?” I asked, 

“Nothing in the world,” was the reply; and replacing the paper, I saw 
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin. It disappeared in 
his glove; and with one hasty nod and “good-afternoon” he vanished, 

“Well!” I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, “that caps 
the globe, however!” 

I, in my turn, scrutinized the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few 


JANE EYRE 325 


dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil. I pond- 
ered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and being 
certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed and soon forgot it. 


CHAPTER XXXII 


WueEn Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow. The whirling storm 
continued all night. The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blind 
ing falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up, and almost impassable, 
Thad closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from 
blowing it under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on 
the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle, 
took down Marmion, and beginning— 


“Day set on Norham’s castled steep, 
And Tweed’s fair river broad and deep, 
And Cheviot’s mountains lone; 

The massive towers, the donjon keep, 
The flanking walls that round it sweep, 
In yellow lustre shone”— 


I soon forgot storm in music, 

I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door. No; it was St. 
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen hurricane 
—the howling darkness—and stood before me, the cloak that covered 
his tall figure all white as a glacier. I was almost in consternation, so 
little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up vale that night. 

“Any ill news?” I demanded, “Has anything happened?” 

“No. How very easily alarmed you are!” he answered, removing his 
cloak and hanging it up-against the door, towards which he again coolly 
pushed the mat which his entrance had deranged. He stamped the snow 
from his boots. 

“I shall sully the purity of your floor,” said he, “but you must ex- 
cuse me for once,” Then he approached the fire. “I have had hard work 
to get here, I assure you,” he observed, as he warmed his hands over the 
flame. “One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite 
soft yet.” 

“But why are you come?” J could not forbear saying. 

“Rather an inhospitable question ta put to a visitor; but since you 
ask it, I answer simply, to have a little talk with you. I got tired of my 
mute books and empty rooms. Besides, since yesterday I have experi- 
enced the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half told, and 
who is impatient to hear the sequel.”

He sat down. I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really 
I began to fear his wits were touched. I{ he were insane, however, his 
was a very cool and collected insanity: I had never scen that handsome- 
featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than il did just 
now, as he put aside hig snow-wet hair from his forehead and lel the 
firelight shine free on his pale brow and check as pale, where it grieved 
me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved., 
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least compre- 
hend; but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was 
thinking. It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face. A per- 
haps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my hearl. I was moved to 
say — 

"JT wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad 
that you should be quile alone; and you are recklessly rash about your 
own health,” 

“Nol at all,” said he; “I care for myself when necessary. I am well 
now. What do you see amiss in me?” 

This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed 
that my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous, I was 
silenced. 

He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye 
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate. Thinking it urgent to say some- 
thing, I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, 
which was behind him, 

“No, no!” he responded, shortly and somewhat testily. 

“Well,” I reflected, “if you won’t talk, you may be still; VU Jet you 
alone now, and return to my book.” 

So I snuffed the candle, and resumed the perusal of Marmion. He 
soon stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only 
took out a morocco pocket-book, thence produced a lelter, which he 
read in silence, folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation. It was 
vain. to try to read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could 
I, in my impatience, consent to be dumh, He might rebulf me if he 
likecl, but talk I would. 

“FJave you heard from Diana and Mary lately?” 

“Not since the letter I showed you a weck ago,” 

“There has not been any change made about your own arrange- 
ments? You will not be summoned (o leave England sooner than you 
expected?” 

“T fear not, indeed; such chance is too good to befall me.” Baffled so 
far, I changed my ground. I bethought myself to talk about the school 
and my scholars, 

‘Mary Garrett’s mother is better, and Mary came back to the school 


JANE EYRE 327 


this morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the 
Foundry Close; they would have come to-day but for the snow.” 

“Indeed!” 

“Mr. Oliver pays for two.” 

“Does he?” 

“Fe means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas.” 

“T know.” 

“Was it your suggestion?” 

'No.” 

“Whose, then?” 

“His daughter’s, I think.” 

“Ti is like her; she is so good-natured,” 

“Ves,” 

Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes. It 
aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me. 

“Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire,” he 
said. 

Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied. 

“Half an hour ago,” he pursued, “I spoke of my impatience to hear 
the sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better man- 
aged by my assuming the narrator’s part, and converting you into a 
listener. Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story 
will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often re- 
gain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips. For the 
rest, whether trite or novel, it is short. 

“Twenty years ago, a poor curale—never mind his name at this mo- 
ment—fell in love with a rich man’s daughter; she fell in love with 
him, and married him, against the advice of all her friends, who con- 
sequently disowned her immediately afler the wedding. Before two 
years passed, the rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side 
under one slab. (I have scen their grave; it formed part of the pave- 
ment of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathe- 
dral of an overgrown manufacturing town in ——shire,) They left a 
daughter, which, at its very birth, Charity received in her lap—cold as 
that of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night. Charity carried 
the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; it was 
reared by an aunt-in-law, called (J come to names now) Mrs. Reed of 
Gateshead. Vou start—-did you hear a noise? I daresay it ts only a rat’ 
scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn 
before I had it repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by 
rats.—To proceed. Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it 
was happy or not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at 
the end of that time she transferred it to a place you know-—being no 


328 JANE EYRE 


other than Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself. It seems 
her career there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a 
teacher, like yoursclf—really it strikes me there are parallel points in 
her history and yours. She left it to be a governess—there, again, your 
fates were analogous—she undertook the education of the ward of a 
certain Mr. Rochester.” 

“Mr, Rivers!” J interrupted. 

“I can guess your feclings,” he said, “but restrain them for a while: I 
have nearly finished; hear me to the end. Of Mr. Rochester’s charac- 
ter I know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honour- 
able marriage to this young girl, and that at Lhe very altar she discov- 
ered he hac a wife yet alive, though a lunatic. What his subsequent 
conduct and proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an 
event transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, 
it was discovered she was gone—no one could tell when, where, or how. 
She had left Thornfield fall in the night; every research after her 
course had been vain; the country had been scoured far and wide; no 
vestige of information could be gathered respecting her. Yet that she 
should be found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements 
have been put in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from 
one Mr. Briggs, a solicitor, communicating the details I have just im- 
parted, Is it nol an odd tale?” 

“Just tell me this,” said I, “and since you know so much, you surely 
can. tell it me—what of Mr. Rochester? How and where is he? What is 
he doing? Is he well?” 

“T am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never 
mentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have 
adverted lo. You should rather ask the name of the governess—the 
nature of the event which requires her appearance.” 

“Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then? Did no one see Mr. 
Rochester?” 

“TZ. suppose nol,” 

“But they wrote to him?” 

“Of course,” 

“And what did he say? Who has his letters?” 

“Max. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from 
My. Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed ‘Alice Fairfax,’ ” 

I felt cold and dismayed. My worst fears, then, were probably true: 
he had in all probability lefL England, and rushed in reckless despera~ 
tion Lo some former haunt on the Continent, And what opiate for his 
severe suflerings—what object for his strong passions—had he sought 
there? I dared not answer the question, Oh, my poor master—once al- 
most my husband-—-whom I had often called “my dear Edward!” 


JANE EYRE 329 


“He must have been a bad man,” observed Mr. Rivers, 

“You don’t know him—don’t pronounce an opinion upon him,” 1 
said, with warmth. 

“Very well,” he answered quictly: “and indeed my head is otherwise 
occupied than with him; I have my tale to finish. Since you won’t ask 
the governess’s name, I must tell it of my own accord. Stay! I have it 
here: it is always more satisfactory to see important points written 
down, fairly committed to black and white.” 

And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought 
through: from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of 
paper, hastily torn off. I recognized in its texture and its stains of ul 
tramarine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the portrait- 
cover. He got up, held it close to my eyes; and I read, traced in Indian 
ink, in my own handwriting, the words “Jane Evre”—-the work doubt- 
Jess of some moment of abstraction. 

“Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre,” he said; “the advertisements 
demanded a Jane Eyre; I knew a Jane Elliott. I confess I had my sus- 
picions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once resolved 
into certainty. You own the name and renounce the alias?” 

“Ves—yes; but where is Mr, Briggs? He perhaps knows more of Mr. 
Rochester than you do,” 

“Briggs is in London. I should doubt his knowing anything at all 
about Mr, Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested. Mean- 
time, you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire 
why Mr. Briggs sought after you-—-what he wanted with you.” 

“Well, what did he want?” 

“Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madcira, is dead; 
that he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich—merely 
that—nothing more.” 

“Tl—richr” 

“Yes, you, rich—quite an heiress.” 

Silence succeeded. 

“You must prove your identity, of course,” resumed St. John pres- 
ently—“a step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on 
immediate possession, Your fortune is vested in the English funds; 
Briggs has the will and the necessary documents.” 

Here was a new card turned up! It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted 
. in a moment from indigence to wealth—a very fine thing; but not a 

matter one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once. And 
then there are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giv- 
- ing: this is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing idea] about it; 
all its associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the 
same, One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one 


330 JANE EYRE 


hag got a fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder 
business; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and 
we contain ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow. 

Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words 
Death, Funeral. My uncle I had heard was dead—my only relative; 
ever since being made aware of his existence, £ had cherished the hope 
of one day seeing him: now J never should. And then this money came 
only to me: nol ta me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self, 
IL was a grand boon, doubtless; and independence would be glorious— 
yes, I felt that—zhat thought swelled my heart. 

“You unbend your forehead at last,” said Mr, Rivers. “I thought 
Medusa, had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone, Perhaps 
now you will ask how much you are worth?” 

“Blow much am I worth?” 

“Oh, a trifle! Nothing, of course, to speak of—twenty thousand 
pounds, £ think they say—but what is that?” 

“Twenty thousand pounds?” 

Gere was a new stunner——E bad been calculating on four or five 
thousand. This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr, St. 
Jobn, whom I had never heard Jaugh before, laughed now. 

“Well,” said he, “if you had committed a murder, and I had told you 
your crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast.” 

“Tt is a large sum—~—don’t you think there is a mistake?” 

“No mistake at all.” 

“Perhaps you have read the figures wrong——it may be two thousand|” 

“Tt is written in letters, not figures—twenty thousand.” 

I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical 
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for 
a hundred. Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on. 

“If it were not such a very wild night,” he said, “I would send 
Hannah down to keep you company; you look too desperately miser- 
able to be left alone. But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the 
drifts so well as I-—her legs are not quite so long; so I musi e’en leave 
you to your sorrows. Goodl-night.” 

He was lifting the latch, A sudden thought occurred to me. 

“Stop one minute!” I cried. 

“Well?” 

“Tt puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or 
how he knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the- 
way place, had the power to aid in my discovery,” 

“Oh! I ama clergyman,” he said; “and the clergy are often appealed 
to about odd matters.” Again the latch rattled. 

“No; that does not satisfy me!” I exclaimed; and indeed there was 


JANE EYRE B3r 


something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of allay- 
ing, piqued my curiosity more than ever. 

“It is a very strange piece of business,” I added; “I must know more 
about it.” 

“Another time,” 

“No; to-night!—to-night!” and as he turned from the door, I placed 
myself between it and him. He looked rather embarrassed. 

“Vou certainly shall not go till you have told me all,” I said. 

“T would rather not just now.” 

“Vou shall!—you must!” 

“T would rather Diana or Mary informed you.” 

Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: grati- 
fied it must be, and that without delay; and I told him so. 

“But I apprised you that I was a hard man,” said he, “difficult to 
persuade.” 

“And Iam a hard woman—impossible to put off.” 

“And then,” he pursued, “I am cold; no fervour infects me.” 

“Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice. The blaze there has 
thawed all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has 
streamed on to my floor, and made it like a trampled street, As you 
hope ever to be forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour 
of spoiling a sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know.” 

“Well, then,” he said, “I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your 
perseverance—as stone is worn by continual dropping. Besides, you 
must know some day-—as well now as later. Your name is Jane Eyre?” 

“Qf course; that was all settled before.” 

“You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?—that I was 
christened St. John Eyre Rivers?” 

“No, indeed! I remember now secing the letter E. comprised in your 
initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I 
never asked for what name it stood. But what then? Surely——” 

I stopped; I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express, 
the thought that rushed upon me—that embodied ilself—-that, in a 
second, stood out a strong, solid probability. Circumstances knit them- 
selves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been lying 
hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight—every ring 
was perfect, the connection complete. I knew, by instinct, how the mat- 
ter stood, before St, John had said another word; but I cannot expect 
the reader Lo have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his 
explanation. 

“My mother’s name was Eyre; she had two brothers: one a clergy- 
man, who married Miss Jane Reed of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, 
Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira, Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre’s 


332 JANE EYRE 


solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle’s death, and 
to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman’s 
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never 
forgiven, between him and my father. He wrote again a few weeks 
since, to intimate thal. the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew any- 
thing of her. A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me 
to find her out. You know the rest.” Again he was going, but I set my 
back against the door. 

“Do let me speak,” I said; “let me have onc moment to draw breath 
and reflect.” I paused. He stood before me, hat in hand, looking com- 
posed enough. I resumed— 

“Your mother was my father’s sister?” 

“Vas,” 

“My aunl, consequently?” 

Ve bowed. 

“My uncle John was your uncle John? You, Diana, and Mary are 
his sister’s children, as 1 am his brother’s child?” 

“Undeniably.” 

“Vou three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows 
from (he same source?” 

“We are cousins; yes.” 

T surveyed him. It seemed I had found a brother-—one I could be 
proud of—one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, 
that, when 1 knew them bul as mere strangers, they had inspired me 
with genuine affection and admiration. The two girls, on whom, kneel- 
ing down on the wet ground, and looking through the low, latliced win- 
dow of Moor House kitchen, 1 had gazed with so bilter a mixture of in- 
terest and despair, were my near kinswomen; and Lhe young and state- 
ly genileman who had found me almost dying at his threshold was my 
blood relation. Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch! This was wealth 
indeed !—wealth to the heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections, This 
was a blessing, bright, vivid, and exhilarating: not like the ponderous 
gift of gold—rich dnd welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its 
weight. I now clapped my hands in sudden joy—my pulse bounded, my 
veins thrilled. 

“Oh, Iam glad!—I am gladt” I exclaimed, 

St. John smiled. “Did I not say you neglected essential points to 
pursue trifles?” he asked. “You were serious when I told you you had 
got a fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited.” 

“What can you mean? Ti may be of no moment to you; you have 
sisters, and don’t care for a cousin. Bui I had nobody; and now three 
relalions~~or two, Jf you don’t choose to be counted—are born into my 
world full-grown. I say again, I am glad!” 


JANE EYRE 333 


I walked fast through the room. I stopped, half suffocated with the 
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle them 
—thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere 
long. I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending 
stars—every one lit me to a purpose or delight, Those who had saved 
my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit. 
They were under a yoke—I could free them; they were scattered—I 
could reunite them; the independence, the affluence which was mine, 
might be theirs too. Were we not four? Twenty thousand pounds 
shared equally would be five thousand each—enough and to spare: jus- 
tice would be done, mutual happiness secured. Now the wealth did not 
weigh on me; now it was not a mere bequest of coin— it was a legacy of 
life, hope, enjoyment. 

How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I 
cannot tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair 
behind me, and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it. He 
also advised me to be composed. I scorned the insinuation of helpless- 
ness and distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again. 

“Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow,” I said, “and tell them to 
come home directly. Diana said they would both consider themselves 
rich with a thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very 
well.” 

“Tell me where I can get you a glass of water,” said St. John; “you 
must really make an effort to tranquillize your feelings.” 

“Nonsense! ancl what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you? 
Will it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and set- 
tle down like an ordinary mortal?” 

“You wander; your head becomes confused, I have been too abrupt 
in communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength.” 

“Mr, Rivers! you quite put me out of patience. I am rational 
enough; it is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunder 
stand.” 

“Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should com. 
prehend better,” 

“Explain! What is there to explain? You cannot fail to see that 
twenty thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between 
the nephew and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to 
each? What I want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell 
them of the fortune that has accrued to them.” 

“To you, you mean.” 

“J have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any 
other. I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly ungrate- 
ful. Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections, I like 


334 JANE EYRE 


Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary, 
and 1 will attach mysclf for life to Diana and Mary. It would please 
and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and op- 
press me to have twenty thousand—which, moreover, could never be 
mine in justice, though it might in law. I abandon to you, then, what 
is absolutely superfluous to me. Let there be no opposition, and no 
discussion about it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the 
point at once.” 

“This is acting on first impulses; you must. Lake days to consider such 
a matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid.” 

“Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, 1 am easy: you sce the justice 
of the case?” 

“¥ do see a certain justice; but il is contrary to all custom. Besides, 
the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts; 
he was free io leave it to whom he would; he left it to you. After all, 
justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience, con- 
sider it absolutely your own.” 

“With me,” said J, “it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of con- 
science: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an oppor- 
tunity of doing so. Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a 
year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught 
a glimpse—that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning 
to myself life-long friends.” 

“Vou think so now,” rejoined St. John, “because you do not know 
what it is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy, wealth: you cannot 
form a nation of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give 
you; of the place it would enable you to take in society; of the pros- 
pects it would open Lo you: you cannot: Si 

“And you,” I interrupled, “cannot at all imagine the craving I have 
for fraternal and sisterly love. I never had a home, I never had brothers 
or sisters; I must and will have them now. You are not reluctant to ad- 
mil me and own me, are your” 

“Jane, I will be your brother—my sisters will be your sisters—with- 
out stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights.” 

“Brother? Ves; at the distance of a thousand leagues! Sisters? Ves; 
slaving amongst strangers! T, wealthy—gorged with gold I never earned 
and do not merit! You, penniless! Famous cquality and fraterniza- 
tion! Close union! Intimate attachment!” 

“But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness 
may be realized otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you 
may marry,” 

“Nansense again! Marry! I don’t want to marry, and never shall 
marry.” 


JANE EYRE 335 


“That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of 
the excitement under which you labour,” 

“Tt is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are 
my inclinations to the bare thought of marriage. No one would take me 
for love; and £ will not be regarded in the light of a mere money specu- 
lation, And I do not want a stranger—unsympathizing, alien, different 
from me; I want my kindred—those with whom I have full fellow- 
feeling. Say again you will be my brother. When you uttered the words 
I was satished, happy; repeat them, if you can—repeat them sincerely.” 

“T think I can. I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I 
know on what my affection for them is grounded—respect for their 
worth and admiration of their talents. You, too, have principle and 
mind; your tastes and habits resemble Diana’s and Mary’s; your pres- 
ence is always agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for 
some time found a salutary solace. I feel I can easily and naturally 
make room in my heart for you, as my third and youngest sister.” 

“Thank you; that contents me for to-night. New you had better go; 
for if you stay longer, you will perhaps irrilate me afresh by some mis- 
trustful scruple.” 

“And the School, Miss Eyre? It must now be shut up, I suppose?” 

“No. I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute.” 

He smiled approbation. We shook hands, and he took leave. 

I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and argu- 
ments I used, to get matters regarding the legacy setiled as I wished. 
My task was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved—as my 
cousins saw at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on 
making a just division of the property—as they must in their own 
hearts have felt the equity of the intention; and must, besides, have 
been innately conscious that in my place they would have done pre~ 
cisely what I wished to do—they yielded at length so far as to consent 
to put the affair to arbitration. The judges chosen were Mr, Oliver and 
an able lawyer: both coincided in my opinion; I carried my point. The 
instruments of transfer were drawn out: St, John, Diana, Mary, and I 
each became possessed of a competency. 


CHAPTER XXXIV 


Ir was near Christmas by the time all was settled; the season of general 
holiday approached. I now closed Morton school, taking care that the 
parting should not be barren on my side. Good fortune opens the hand 
as well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have 
largely received, is but to afford a vent to the wnusual ebullition of the 


336 JANE EYRE 


sensations. I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic schol- 
ars liked me; and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed: 
they manifested their affection plainly and strongly. Deep was my 
gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated hearts, 
I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I did not 
visit them, and give them an hour’s teaching in their school. 

Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classcs, now numbering sixty 
girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in 
my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half- 
dozen of my best scholars—as decent, respectable, modest, and well- 
informed young women as could be found in the ranks of the British 
peasantry, And that is saying a great deal; for, after all, the British 
peasantry are the best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of 
any in Europe. Since those days I have seen paysannes and béuerinnen; 
and the best of them seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, com- 
pared with my Morton girls. 

“Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exer- 
tion?” asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone, “Does not the con- 
sciousness of having done some rea] good in your day and generation 
give pleasure?” 

‘Doubtless.” 

“And you have only toiled a few months! Would not a life devoted 
to the task of regenerating your race be well spent?” 

“Yes,” I said; “but I could not go on for ever so. I want to enjoy my 
own faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people. I must enjoy 
them now. Don’t recall cither my mind or body to the school; I am 
out of it and disposed for full holiday.” 

He looked grave. “What now? What sudden eagerness is this you 
evince? What are you going to dor” 

“To be active—~—as active as I can, And first I must beg you to set 
Hannah at liberty, and gel somebody else to wail on you.” 

“Do you want her?” 

“Yes, to go wilh me to Moor House, Diana and Mary will be at 
home in a week, and 1 want to have everything in order against their 
artival,” 

“T understand. I thought you were for flying off on some excursion. 
It is better so; Hannah shall go with you.” 

“Tell her to be ready by to-morrow, then, And here is the school- 
room key; I will give you the key of my cottage in the moming.” 

He took it. “You give it up very gleefully,” said he; “I don’t quite 
understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employ- 
ment you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are relin«

quishing. What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you 
now?” 

“My first aim will be to clean down (do you comprehend the full 
force of the expression?)—to clean down Moor House from chamber 
to cellar; my next to rub it up with bees’-wax, oil, and an indefinite 
number of cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, 
table, bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall 
go near to ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every 
room; and lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are 
expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, 
sorting of currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, 
chopping up of materials for mince-pies, and solemnizing of other culin- 
ary rites, as words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the un- 
initiated like you. My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an 
absolutely perfect stale of readiness for Diana and Mary before next 
Thursday; and my ambition is to give them a beau idéal of a welcome 
when they come.” 

St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied. 

“Tt is all very well for the present,” said he; “but seriously, I trust 
that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little higher 
than domestic endearments and household joys.” 

“The best things the world has!” I interrupted. 

“No, Jane, no, This world is not the scene of fruition—do not at- 
tempt to make it so; nor of rest—do not turn slothful.” 

“T mean, on the contrary, to be busy.” 

“Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months’ grace I allow you 
for the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself 
with this late-found charm of relationship; but then, I hope you will 
begin to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and 
the selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilized affluence. I hope your 
energies will then once more trouble you with their strength.” 

I looked at him with surprise. “St. John,” I said, “I think you are 
almost wicked to talk so. I am disposed to be as content as a queen, 
and you try to stir me up to restlessness! To what end?” 

“To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed 
to your keeping, and of which He will surely one day demand a strict 
account. Jane, [ shall watch you closely and anxiously—I warn you of 
that. And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you 
throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures. Don’t cling so ten- 
aciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an 
adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects, Do 
you hear, Jane?” 


338 JANE EYRE 


“Ves; just as if you were speaking Greek, I feel I have adequate 
cause Lo be happy, and I will be happy. Good-bye!” 

Happy at Moor House J was, and hard I worked; and so did Han- 
nah: she was charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of 
a house turned topsy-turvy—how I could brush, and dust, and clean, 
and cook. And really, after a day or two of confusion worse confound- 
ed, it was delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves 
had made. I had previously taken a journey to S—— Lo purchase some 
new furniture: my cousins having given me carte blanche to effect what 
alterations I pleased, and a sum having been sel aside for that purpose. 
The ordinary siiling-room and bedrooms I left much as they were; for I 
knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again 
the old homely tables and chairs and beds, than from the spectacle of 
the smartest innovations. Still some novelty was necessary, lo give to 
their return the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested. Dark 
handsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully 
sclected antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and 
mirrors, and dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: 
they looked fresh without being glaring, A spare parlour and bedroom 
I refurnished entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery; I 
laid canvas on the passage, and carpets on the stairs, When all was fin- 
ished, I thought Moor House as complete 2 model of bright, modest 
snugness within, as it was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste 
and desert dreariness without. 

The eventful Thursday at length came. They were expected about 
dark, and ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in 
perfect (rim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness. 

St. John arrived first. I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the 
house till everything was arranged; and, indeed, the bare idea of the 
commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls, sufficed 
to scare him to estrangement, He found me in the kitchen, watching 
the progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking. Approaching the 
hearth, he asked, “If I was at last satisfied with housemaid’s work?” J 
answered by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of 
the result of my Jabours. With some difficulty, I got him to make the 
tour of the house. He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he 
had wandered upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through 
a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable 
changes in so short a time: but nota syllable did he utter indicating 
pleasure in the improved aspect of his abode, 

This silence damped me. I thought perhaps the alterations had dis- 
turbed some old associations he valued. I inquired whether this was the 
case—no doubt in a somewhat crestfallen tone. 


JANE EYRE 339 


“Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupu- 
lously respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have be- 
stowed more thought on the matter than it was worth. How many min- 
utes, for instance, had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this 
very room?——By-the-byc, could I tell him where such a book was?” 

I showed him the volume on the shelf. He took it down, and with- 
drawing to his accustomed window recess, he began to read it. 

Now, I did not like this, reader. St. John was a good man; but T be- 
gan to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard 
and cold. The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for 
him—its peaceful enjoyments no charm. Literally, he lived only to 
aspire—after what was good and great, certainly; but still he would 
never rest, nor approve of others resting round him. As I looked at his 
lofty forchead, still and pale as a white stone—at his fine lineaments 
fixed in study—I comprehended all at once that he would hardly make 
a good husband; that it would be a trying thing to be his wife. I under- 
stood, as by inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed 
with him that it was but a love of the senses. I comprehended how he 
should despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; 
how he should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its 
ever conducing permanently to his happiness or hers, I saw he was of 
the material from which nature hews her heroes—Christian and pagan 
—her Jawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark 
for great interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold, 
cumbrous column, gloomy and out of place. 

“This parlour is not his sphere,” I reflected: “the Himalayan ridge 
or Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp, would 
suit him better, Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not 
his element: there his faculties stagnate—they cannot develop or ap- 
pear to advantage. It is in scenes of strife and danger—-where courage 
is proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked—that he will 
speak and move, the leader and superior. A merry child would have 
the advantage of him on this hearth, He is right to choose a mission-~ 
ary’s career—lI see it now.” 

“They are coming! they are coming!” cried Hannah, throwing open 
the parlour door. At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully. Out 
Iran. It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible. Hannah 
soon had a lantern lit, The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the 
driver opened the door: first one well-known form, then another, step- 
ped out. In a minute J had my face under their bonnets, in contact 
first with Mary’s soft cheek, then with Diana’s flowing curls, They 
laughed—kissed me—then Hannah; patted Carlo, who was half wild 


340 JANE EYRE 


with delight; asked eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the 
affirmative, hastened into the house. 

They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and - 
chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances ex- 
panded to the cheerful firelighl. While the driver and Hannah brought 
in the boxes, they demanded St. John. At this moment he advanced from 
the parlour. They both threw their arms round his neck at once, He 
gave each one quict kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, 
stood a while to Le talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they 
would soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of 
refuge. 

T had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give hos- 
pitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me, They 
were delighted with the renovation and decoration of their rooms— 
with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases: 
they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly. I had the pleasure of 
feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I 
had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home. 

Sweet was that evening. My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so 
eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St, 
John’s taciturnity. He was sincerely glad to sec his sisters, but in their 
glow of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathize. The event of 
the day—that is, the return of Diana and Mary—pleased him; but the 
accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of 
reception, irked him, I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come, In 
the very meridian of the night’s enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a 
rap was heard at the door. Hannah entered with the intimation that 
“a poor Jad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch My, Rivers to see 
his mother, who was drawing away.” 

“Where does she live, Hannah?” 

“Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and 
moss all the way,” 

“Tell him I will go.” 

“I’m sure, sir, you had better not. It’s the worst road to travel after 
dark that can be; there’s no track at all over the bog. And then it is 
such a bitter night—-the keenest wind you ever felt. You had better’ 
send word, sir, that you will be there in the morning.” 

But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without 
one objection, onc murmur, he departed. It was then nine o'clock: he 
did not return till midnight. Starved and tired enough he was, but he 
looked happier than when he set out. He had performed an act of duty; 
made an exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on 
better terms with himself. 


JANE EYRE 341 


I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience. It was 
Christmas week. We took to no settled employment, but spent it in a 
sort of merry domestic dissipation, The air of the moors, the freedom 
of home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary’s spitits 
like some life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and 
from noon till night. They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, 
pithy, original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, 
and sharing in it, to doing anything else. St. John did not rebuke our 
vivacity, but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish 
was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in visit- 
ing the sick and poor in its different districts. 

One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for 
some minutes, asked him, “If his plans were yet unchanged.” 

“Unchanged and unchangeable,” was the reply. And he proceeded to 
inform us that his departure from England was now definitely fixed for 
the ensuing year. 

“And Rosamond Oliver?” suggested Mary, the words seeming to 
escape her lips involuntarily; for no sooner had she ultered them, than 
she made a gesture as if wishing to recall them. St. John had a book in 
his hand—it was his unsocial custom to read al meals. He closed it, 
and looked up. 

“Rosamond Oliver,” said he, “is about to be married to Mr. Granby, 
one of the best connected and most estimable residents in S——, grand- 
son and heir to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her 
father yesterday.” 

His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at 
him: he was serene as glass. 

“The match must have been got up hastily,” said Diana; “they can- 
not have known each other long.” 

“But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S——. 
But where there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, 
where the connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: 
they will be married as soon as S—— Place, which Sir Frederic gives up 
to them, can be refitted for their reception.” 

The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt 
tempted to inquire if the event distressed him; but he secmed so little 
to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I ex- 
perienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already haz- 
arded. Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him; his reserve was 
again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it. He had 
not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made 
little, chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the 
development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his 


342 JANE EYRE 


kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance 
between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the 
village schoolmistress. When I remembered how far I had once been 
admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present 
frigidity. 

Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his 
head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said,— 

“You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won.” 

Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply. After 
a moment’s hesilation I answered,— 

“But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors 
whose triumphs have cost them too dear? Would nol such another ruin 
you?” 

“T think nol; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never 
be called upon to contend for such another. The event of the conflict 
is decisive: my way is now clear; | thank God for it!” So saying, he 
returned to his papers and his silence. 

As our mutual happiness (that is, Diana’s, Mary’s, and mine) settled 
into a quicler character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular 
studies, Si. John stayed more at home: he sat wilh us in the same room, 
sometimes for hours together. While Mary drew, Diana pursued a 
course of encyclopedic reading she had (lo my awe and amazement) 
undertaken, and I fagged away al German, he pondered a mystic lore 
of his own—that of some Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he 
thought necessary Lo his plans. 

Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and ab- 
sorbed enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the ont- 
landish-looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing 
upon us, his fcllow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: 
if caught, it would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, il re- 
turned searchingly to our table. I wondered what it meant, I wondered, 
too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion 
that seemed to me of small moment—namely, my weekly visit to Mor- 
ton school; and still more was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavour- 
able, if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me 
not ta go, he would invariably make light of their solicitude, and en- 
courage me to accomplish the Lask without regard to the clements. 

“Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her,” he would say: 
“she can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few fakes of snow, as 
well as any of us. Her constitution is both sound and elastic—hbetter 
calculated to endure variations of climale than many more robust.” 

And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired and not a little 
weather-beaten, [ never dared complain, because { saw that to murmur 


JANE EYRE 343 


would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse 
was a special annoyance. 

One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really 
had a cold. His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead. I sat reading 
Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls. As I exchanged 
a translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found 
myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye. How long it 
had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I can- 
not tell. So keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment super- 
stitious—as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny, 

“Jane, what are you doing?” 

“Learning German.” 

“T want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee.” 

“You are not in earnest?” 

“In such earnest that I must have it so; and J will tell you why.” 

He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was 
himself at present studying; that as he advanced, he was apt to forget 
the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil 
with whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix 
them thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some 
time between me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because 
he saw I could sit at a task the longest of the three. Would I do him 
this favour? I should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, a9 
it wanted now barely three months to his departure. 

St. John was not a man to be lightly refused; you felt that every im- 
pression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and 
permanent, I consented. When Diana and Mary returned, the former 
found her scholar transferred from her to her brother. She laughed, and 
both she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded 
them to such a step. He answered quietly,— 

“T know it.” 

I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting mas- 
ter: he expected me to do a great deal; and when I [fulfilled his expec- 
tations, he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation. By degrees 
he acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of 
mind: his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference. 
T could no longer talk or laugh frcely when he was by, because a tire- 
somely importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) 
was distasteful to him, I was so fully aware that only seriaus moods and 
occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain 
or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell. When he 
said “Go,” I went; “Come,” I came; “Do this,” I did it. But I did not 


344 JANE EYRE 


love my servitude; I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect 
me, 

One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bid- 
ding him good-night, he kissed cach of them, as was his custom; and, as 
was equally his custom, he gave me his hand. Diana, who chanced to be 
in a frolicsome humour (she was not painfully controlled by his will; 
for hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed,— 

“St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don’t 
treat her as such: you should kiss her too.” 

She pushed me towards him. I thought Diana very provoking, and 
felt uncomfortably confused; and while 1 was (hus thinking and feeling, 
St. John bent his head, his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, 
his eyes questioned my eyes piercingly—he kissed me. There are no 
such things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesias- 
tical cousin’s salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be 
experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss. When given, he 
viewed me to learn the result: it was not striking. I am sure I did not 
blush; perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I fell as if this kiss 
were a seal affixed to my fetters, He never omitted the ceremony after. 
wards. and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it seemed 
to invest it for him with a certain charm, 

As for me, I daily wished more to please him; bul to do so, I felt 
daily more and more thal I must disown half my nature, stifle half my 
facullies, wresl my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the 
adoplion of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation. He wanted 
to irain me to an clevation I could never reach; il racked me hourly to 
aspire to the standard he uplifted. The thing was as impossible as to 
mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, Lo give 
to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn Lusire of his 
own. 

Not his ascendency alone, however, held me in thrall at present, Of 
Jale il had becn easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering cvil sat at 
my heart and drained my happiness at its source—the evil of suspense, 

Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst 
these changes of place and fortune. Not for a moment. His idea was 
still with me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a 
sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven ona 
tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed. The craving to 
know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at 
Morton, I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and 
now at Moor House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it. 

In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about 
the will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's pres- 


JANE EYRE 345 


ent residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he 
was quite ignorant of all concerning him. I then wrote to Mrs. Fair- 
fax, entreating information on the subject. I had calculated with cer- 
tainty on this step answering my end; I felt sure it would elicit an early 
answer. I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but 
when two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and 
brought nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety. 

I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed. 
Renewed hope followed renewed effort; it shone like the former for 
some wecks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word 
reached me. When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died 
out, and then I felt dark indeed. 

A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy. Summer ap- 
proached. Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to 
accompany me to the seaside. This St. John opposed: he said I did not 
want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too pur- 
poseless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying defici- 
encies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and grew 
more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool, never 
thought of resisting him—TI could not resist him. 

One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual: the 
ebb was occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment. Hannah had 
told me in the morning there was a letter for mc, and when I went down 
to take it, almost certain that the long-looked-for tidings were vouch- 
safed me at last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on 
business. The bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, 
as I sat poring over the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an 
Indian scribe, my eyes filled again. 

St, John called me to his side to read. In attempting to do this my 
voice failed me; words were lost in sqbs. He and I were the only oc- 
cupants of the parlour. Diana was practising her music in the drawing- 
room, Mary was gardening—it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, 
and breezy. My companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor 
did he question me as to its cause; he only said,— 

“We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.” 
And while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and 
patient, leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with 
the eye of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's 
malady. Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered some- 
thing about not being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and 
succeeded in completing it. St. John put away my books and his, locked 
his desk, and said,— 

“Now, Jane, you shall take a walk, and with me.” 


346 JANE EYRE 


“T will call Diana and Mary.” 

“No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you. 
Put on your things; go oul by the kitchen-door; take the road towards 
the head of Marsh Glen. I will join you in a moment.” 

I know no medium—lI never in my life have known any medium in 
my dealings with positive, hard characters, antagonistic lo my own, be- 
tween absolute submission and determined revoll. I have always faith- 
fully observed the one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes 
with volcanic vehemence, into the other; and as neither present cir- 
cumstances warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I 
observed careful obedience to St. John’s directions; and in ten minutes 
I was treading the wild track of the glen, side by side vith him. 

The breeze was from the west—il came over the hills, sweet with 
scents of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the streams de- 
scending the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plenti- 
ful and clear, catching golden gleams from the sun and sapphire tints 
from the firmament. As we advanced and left the track we trod a soft 
turf, mossy fine and emerald green, minutely cnamelled with a tiny 
white flower and spangled with a starlike yellow blossom. The hills, 
meantime, shut us quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to 
their very core. 

“Let us rest here,” said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of 
a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck 
rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain 
shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for gem 
—where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh 
for the frowning-——where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a 
last refuge for silence. 

I took a seat; St, John stood near me, He looked up the pass and 
down the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and re- 
turned to traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it. THe removed 
his hat, to let the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow, He seemed in 
communion with the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell 
to something. 

“And T shall see it again,” he said aloud, “in dreams when I sleep by 
the Ganges; and again in a more remote hour—when another slumber 
overcomes me—~on the shore of a darker stream!” 

Strange words of a strange love! An austere patriot’s passion for his 
fatherland! He sat down. For half an hour we never spoke—neither he 
to me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced,— 

“Jane, J go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman 
which sails on the zoth of June.” 


JANE EVRE 347 


“God will protect you, for you have undertaken His work,” I an- 
swered. 

“Yes,” said he, “there is my glory and joy. I am the servant of an 
infallible Master. I am not going out under human guidance, subject 
to the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my 
king, my lawgiver, my captain is the All-perfect. It seems strange to 
me that all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner—to 
join in the same enterprise.” 

“All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to 
wish to march with the strong.” 

“T do not speak to the feeble, or think of them; I address only such 
as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it,” 

“Those are few in number, and difficult to discover.” 

“You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up—to urge 
and exhort them to the effort—to show them what their gifts are, and 
why they were given—to speak Heaven’s message in their ear—to offer 
them, direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen.” 

“Ti they are really qualified for the task, will nat their awn hearts be 
the first to inform them of it?” 

I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me; 
I trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare 
and rivet the spell. 

“And what does your heart say?” demanded St, John. 

“My heart is mute—my heart is mute,” I answered, struck and 
thrilled. 

“Then I must speak for it,” continued the deep, relentless voice. 
“Jane, come with me to India—come as my helpmeet and fellow-la- 
bourer.” 

The glen and sky spun round, the hills heaved! It was as if I had 
heard a summons from Heaven—as if a visionary messenger, like him 
of Macedonia, had enounced, “Come over and help us!” But I was no 
apostle--I could not behold the herald—I could not receive his call 

“O St. John!” I cried, “have some mercy!” 

I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty, 
knew neither mercy nor remorse. He continued,— 

“God and nature intended you for a missionary’s wife. It is not per- 
sonal but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for 
labour, not for love. A missionary’s wife you must-——shall be, You shall 
be mine: I claim you—not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign’s 
service,” 

“I am not fit for it; I have no vocation,” I said. 

He had calculated on these first objections; he was not irritated by 
them. Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his 


348 JANE EVRE 


arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for 
a long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to 
last him to its close—~resolved, however, that that close should be con- 
quest for him. 

“Humility, Jane,” said he, “is the groundwork of Christian virtues. 
You say right that you are not fit for the work, Who is fit for it? Or 
who, that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the sum- 
mons? I, for instance, am but dust and ashes, With St, Paul, I acknowl- 
edge myself the chicfest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my 
personal vileness to daunt me. I know my Leader——that He is just ag 
well as mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform 
a great task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, sup- 
ply the inadequacy of the means to the end. Think like me, Jane— 
trust like me, It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on; do not 
doubt but it will bear the weight of your human weakness.” 

“T do not understand a missionary life; I have never studied mis- 
sionary labours.” 

“There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want. I can set 
you your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from 
moment to moment. This I could do in the beginning; soon (for I know 
your powers) you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not 
require my help.” 

“Rut my powers-—where are they for this undertaking? I do not 
feel them. Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk. I am sensible 
of no light kindling——no life quickening—no voice counselling or cheer- 
ing, Oh, I wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this 
moment like a rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its 
depths—the fear of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot 
accomplish |” 

“T have an answer for you—hear it, I have watched you ever since 
we first met; I have made you my study for ten months; I have proved 
you in that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited? In 
the village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly, 
labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could per- 
form it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled. In 
the calm with which you learned you had become suddenly rich, I read 
a roind clear of the vice of Demas—lucre had no undue power over you, 
In the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four 
shares, keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others 
to the claim of abstract justice, I recognized a soul that revelled in the 
flame and excitement of sacrifice. In the tractability with which, at my 
wish, you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted 
another because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which 


cs 


JANE EYRE 349 


you have since persevered in it—in the unflagging energy and unshaken 
temper with which you have met its difficulties-—I acknowledge the 
complement of the qualities I seek. Jane, you are docile, diligent, disin- 
terested, faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very he- 
roic: cease 1o mistrust yourself—I can trust you unreservedly. As a 
conductress of Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, 
your assistance will be to me invaluable.” 

My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow, 
sure step. Shul my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in 
making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear. 
My work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed 
itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping 
hand. He waited for an answer. I demanded a quarter of an hour to 
think, before I again hazarded a reply. 

“Very willingly,” he rejoined; and rising, he strode a litile distance 
up the path, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still. 

“JT can do whal he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknow}- 
edge that,” I meditated—‘that is, if life be spared me. But I feel mine 
is not the existence Lo be long protracted under an Indian sun. What 
then? He docs not care for that: when my time came to die, he would 
resign me, in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me, The 
case is very plain before me. In leaving England, I should leave a loved 
but empty land—Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, 
what can that ever be to me? My business is to live without him now; 
nothing so absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were 
waiting some impossible change in circumstances which might reunite 
me to him, Of course (as St, John once said) I must seek another in- 
terest in life to replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers 
me truly the most glorious man can adopt or God assign? Is it not, by 
its noble cares and sublime resulls, the one best calculated to fill the 
void left by uptorn affections and demolished hopes? I believe I must 
say, Yes; and yet I shudder. Alas! If I join St. John, I abandon half 
myself; if T go to India, I go to premature death, And how will the in- 
terval between leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be 
filled? Oh, I know well! That, too, is very clear to my vision. By 
straining to satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I shall satisfy him—to 
the finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations. 
Tf I do go with him—if I do make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it 
absolutely: I will throw all on the altar—heart, vitals, the entire vic- 
tim. He will never love me, but he shall approve me; I will show him 
energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected. Yes, 1 
can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging, 

“Consent, then, to his demand is possible, but for one item—one 


350 JANE EYRE 


dreadful item. It is—that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of 
a husband’s heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which 
the stream is foaming in yonder gorge. He prizes me as a soldier would 
a good weapon, and that is all. Unmarricd to him, this would never 
grieve me; but can I Iet him complete his calculations—coolly put into 
practice his plans—go through the wedding ceremony? Can T receive 
from him the bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt 
not he would scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite 
absent? Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows 
is a sacrifice mace on principle? No; such a martyrdom would be 
monstrous. I will never undergo it. As his sister, I might accompany 
him—not as his wife, I will tell him so.” 

T looked towards the knoll. There he lay, still as a prostrate column; 
his face turned 1o me~-his eye beaming watchful and keen, He started 
to his feet and approached me. 

“J am ready to go to India, if I may go free.” 

“Your answer requires a commentary,” he said; “it is not clear.” 

“Vou have hitherto been my adopted brother—I, your adopted sister: 
let us continue as such: you and EF had better not marry.” 

He shook his head. “Adopted fraternity will not do in this case, If 
you were my real sister, it would be different; I should take you, and 
seck no wife. But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and 
sealed by marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose them- 
selves to any other plan, Do you not see it, Jane? Consider a moment 
—your strong sense will guide you.” 

T did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only 
to the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should, and 
therefore it inferred we ought not to marry. I said so. “St. John,” I 
returned, “I regard you as a brother-~you, me as a sister: so let us 
continue.” 

“We cannot—we cannot,” he answered, with short, sharp determina- 
tion; “il would not do. You have said you will go with me to India: 
remember—you have said that.” 

“Conditionally.” 

“Well—well. To the main point—the departure with me from Eng- 
land, ihe co-operation wiih me in my future labours—you do not ob- 
ject. You have already as good as put your hand to the plough; you are 
Loo consistent to withdraw it. You have but one end to keep in view— 
how the work you have undertaken can best be done. Simplify your 
complicated interests, feclings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all con- 
siderations in one purpose: that of fulfilling with effect—with power 
—~the mission of your great Master, To do so, you must have a coadju- 
tor: not a brother—that is a loose tie—but a husband. I, too, do not 


JANE EYRE 35£ 


want a sister: a sister might any day be taken from me. I want a wife: 
the sole helpmeet I can influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely 
till death.” 

I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow—his hold 
on my limbs. 

“Seek one elsewhere than in me, St, John—seck one fitted to you.” 

“One fitted to my purpose, you mean—fitted to my vocation. Again 
I tell you it is not the insignificant private individual—the mere man, 
with the man’s selfish senses—I wish to mate; it is the missionary.” 

“And I will give the missionary my energies—it is all he wants—but 
not myself; that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel. 
For them he has no use: I retain them.” 

“Vou cannot—you ought not. Do you think God will be satisfied with 
half an oblation? Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice? It is the cause 
of God I advocate; it is under His standard I enlist you. I cannot ac- 
cept on His behalf a divided allegiance; it must be entire.” 

“Oh! I will give my heart to God,” I said. “You do not want it.” 

I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed 
sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the 
feeling that accompanied it. I had silently feared St. John till now, 
because I had not understood him, He had held me in awe, because he 
had held me in doubt, How much of him was saint, how much mortal, 
I could not heretofore tell; but revelations were being made in this 
conference—the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes. 
I saw his fallibilities: I comprehended them. I understood that, sitting 
there where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form 
before me, I sat at the feet of a man, erring as I, The veil fell from his 
hardness and despotism. Having felt in him the presence of these qual- 
ities, I felt his imperfection and took courage. I was with an equal— 
one with whom I might argue—one whom, if I saw good, I might resist. 

He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently 
risked an upward glance at his countenance. His eye, bent on me, ex- 
pressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry. “Is she sarcastic, and 
sarcastic to me/’” it seemed to say, “What does this signify?” 

“Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter,” he said ere long; 
“one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin, I 
trust, Jane, you are in carnest when you say you will give your heart to 
God: it is all I want. Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on 
your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on 
earth will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do 
at once whatever furthers that end. You will see what impetus would 
be given to your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in 
marriage: the only union that gives a character of permanent con- 


352 JANE EYRE 


formity to the destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over 
all minor caprices—all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling—all 
scruple about the degree, kind, strength, or tenderness of mere per- 
sonal inclination—you will hasten to enter into that union at once.” 

“Shall I?” I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in 
their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his 
brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and 
searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure—and fancied my- 
self in iclea Ads wife. Oh! it would never do! As his curate, his comrade, 
all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that capacity; toil 
under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that office; admire and 
emulate his courage and devotion and vigour; accommodate quietly to 
his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his ineradicable ambition; dis- 
criminate the Christian from the man—profoundly esteem the one, and 
freely forgive the other. I should suffer often, no doubt, attached to 
him only in this capacity: my body would be under rather a stringent 
yoke, but my heart and mind would be free, I should still have my un- 
blighted self to turn to—nry natural unenslaved feelings with which to 
communicate in moments of loneliness. There would be recesses in my 
mind which would be only mine, to which he never came, and senti- 
ments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity could never 
blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as his wife 
at his side always, and always restrained, and always checked—forced 
to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel it to burn in- 
wardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame consumed 
vital after vital—-iiis would be unendurable. 

“St. John!” I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation. 

“Well?” he answered icily. 

"T repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, 
but not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you,” 

“A part of me you must become,” he answered steadily; “otherwise 
the whole bargain is void. How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out 
with me to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me? How 
can we be for ever together—sometimes in solitucles, sometimes amidst 
savage tribes—and unwed?” 

“Very well,” I said shortly; “under the circumstances, quite as well 
as if I were cither your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like your- 
self,” 

“Tt is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as 
such: to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both. 
And for the rest, though you have a man’s vigorous brain, you have a 
woman’s heart, and-—it would not do.” 

“Jt would do,” I affirmed, with some disdain, “perfectly well. I have 


JANE EYRE 353 


a woman’s heart, but not where you are concerned. For you I have only 
a comrade’s constancy; a fellow-soldier’s frankness, fidelity, frater- 
nity, if you like; a neophyte’s respect and submission to his hierophant: 
nothing more—don’t fear.” 

“Tt is what I want,” he said, speaking to himself; “it is just what I 
want. And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down. 
Janc, you would not repent marrying me-—be certain of that; we must 
be married. I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough 
of love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in 
your eyes.” 

“I scorn your idea of love,” I could not help saying, as I rose up and 
stood before him, leaning my back against the rock. “I scom the coun- 
terfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you 
offer it.” 

He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so, 
Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell-—~ 
he could command his countenance thoroughly. 

“T scarcely expected to hear that expression from you,” he said: “I 
think I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn.” 

I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm 
mien. 

“Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have 
been roused to speak so unguardedly. You have introduced a topic on 
which our natures are at variance—a topic we should never discuss: the 
very name of love is an apple of discord between us. If the reality were 
required, what should we do? How should we feel? My dear cousin, 
abandon your scheme of marriage—forget it.” 

“No,” said he; “it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which 
can secure my great end. But I shall urge you no further at present. 
To-morrow I leave home for Cambridge; I have many friends there to 
whom I should wish to say farewell. I shall be absent a fortnight: take 
that space of time to consider my offer; and do not forget that if you 
reject it, it is not me you deny, but God. Through my means, He opens 
to you a noble career; as my wife only can you enter uponit. Refuse ta 
be my wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and 
barren obscurity. Tremble Jest in that case you should be numbered 
with those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!” 

He had done: Tuxning from me, he once more 


“Looked to river, looked to hill,” 


But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart; I was not worthy 
to hear them uttered, As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in 
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere 


354 JANE EYRE 


and despotic nature, which bas met resistance where it expected sub- 
mission; the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has 
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to sym- 
pathize;—-in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into 
obedience; it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with 
my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance, 

That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget 
even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence. J-~who, 
though I had no love, had much friendship for him—was hurt by the 
marked omission-——so much hurt that tears started to my eyes. 

“T see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,” said Diana, 
“during your walk on the moor. But go after him; he is now lingering 
in. the passage expecting you—he will make it up.” 

I have not much pride under such circumstances—{I would always 
rather be happy than dignified; and I ran after him, He stood at the 
foot of the stairs. 

“Good-night, St. John,” said I. 

“Good-night, Jane,” he replied calmly. 

“Then shake hands,” I added. 

What a cold, loose touch he impressed on my fingers! He was deeply 
displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm 
nor tears move him. No happy reconciliation was to be had with him— 
no cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient 
and placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that 
he was not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation—~ 
that he had nothing to forgive, not having been offended. 

And with that answer he left me, I would much rather he had knock- 
ed me down, 


CHAPTER XXXV 


He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would, 
He deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made 
me feel what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet 
implacable man can inflict on one who has offended him, Without one 
overt act of hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me 
momently with the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his 
favour. 

Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness-—~ 
not that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully 
in his power to do so, Both by nature and principle he was superior to 
the mean gratification of vengeance. He had forgiven me for saying I 
scorned him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as 


JANE EYRE 355 


long as he and I lived he never would forget them. I saw by his look, 
when he turned to me, that they were always written on the air between 
me and him; whenever J spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, 
and their echo toned every answer he gave me. 

He did not abstain from conversing with me—he even called me as 
usual each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man 
within him had a pleasure unimparted to and unshared by the pure 
Christian, in evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speak- 
ing apparently just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase 
the spirit of interest, and approval which had formerly communicated a 
certain austere charm to his language and manner. To me, he was in 
reality become no longer flesh but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, 
blue gem; his tongue a speaking instrument—nothing more. 

All this was torture to me—refined, lingering Lorture, It kept up 4 
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed 
and crushed me altogether, I felt how, if I were his wife, this good man, 
pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing 
from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal 
conscience the faintest stain of crime. Especially I felt this when I 
made any attempt to propitiate him. No ruth met my ruth, He experi- 
enced no suffering from estrangement—no yearning after reconciliation; 
and though, more than once, my fast falling tears blistered the page 
over which we both bent, they produced no more effect on him than if 
his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal, To his sisters, 
meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual—as if afraid that mere 
coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I was ban- 
ished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am sure 
he did not by malice, but on principle. 

The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the 
garden about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this 
man, alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were 
near relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friend- 
ship, I went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little 
gate; I spoke to the point at once, 

“St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me. Let us 
be friends.” 

“T hope we are friends,” was the unmoved reply; while he still watch- 
ed the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I ap- 
proached. : 

“No, St. John, we are not friends as we were. You know that.” 

“Ave we not? That is wrong, For my part, I wish you no ill and all 
good.” 

“T believe you, St. John, for I am sure you are incapable of wishing 


356 JANE EYRE 


any one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat 
more of affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend ta 
mere strangers.” 

“Of course,” he said. “Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from re- 
garding you as a stranger.” 

This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling 
enough, Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should 
immediately have Ieft him; but something worked within me more 
strongly than those feelings could. I deeply venerated my cousin’s talent 
and principle. His friendship was of value to me; to lose it tried me 
severely. I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it, 

“Must we part in this way, St. John? And when you go to India, will 
you leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?” 

He now turned quite from the moon and faced me. 

“When I go to India, Jane, will I leave your? What! do you not go to 
IndiaP” 

“Vou said I could not unless I married you.” 

“And you will not marry me? You adhere to that resolution?” 

Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put 
into the ice of their questions? how much of the fall of the avalanche is 
in their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure? 

“No, St. John, I will not marry you. I adhere to my resolution.” 

The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet 
crash down. 

“Once more, why this refusal?” he asked. 

“Tormerly,” I answered, “because you did not love me; now, I reply, 
because you almost hale me. If I were to marry you, you would kill 
me. You are killing me now.” 

His lips and checks turned white—quile white. 

“7 should kill you—I am killing youl Your words are such as ought 
not to be used—violent, unferninine, and untrue. They betray an un- 
fortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem 
inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even 
until seventy-and-seven times.” 

I had finished the business now. While earnestly wishing Lo erase 
from his mind the trace of my former offence, J had stamped on that 
tenacious surface another and far deeper impression: I had burnt it in. 

“Now you will indeed hate me,’ I said. “It is useless to attempt to 
conciliate you; I see I have made an eternal enemy of you,” 

A fresh wrong did these words inflict-—the worse, because they touch- 
ed on the truth, That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm, I 
knew the steely ire I had whetted, I was heart-wrung. 


JANE EVRE 357 


“Vou utterly misinterpret my words,” I said, at once seizing his hand. 
“T have no intention to grieve or pain you—indeed, I have not.” 

Most bitterly he smiled—most decidedly he withdrew his hand from 
mine. ‘And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, 
I presume?” said he, after a considerable pause. 

“Vos, I will, as your assistant,” I answered. 

A very long silence succeeded, What struggle there was in him be- 
tween Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular 
gleams scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face. 
He spoke at last. 

“T before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age 
proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine. I proved it to 
you in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your 
ever again alluding to the plan. That you have done so, I regret-—for 
your sake,” 

I interrupted him. Anything like a tangible reproach gave me cour- 
age at once. “Keep to common sense, St. John; you are verging on 
nonsense. You pretend to be shocked by what I have said, You are not 
really shocked; for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so 
dull or so conceited as to misunderstand my meaning. I say again, I 
will be your curate, if you like, but never your wife.” 

Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion 
perfectly. He answered emphatically but calmly,— 

“A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me. With 
me, then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, 
I will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs 
a coadjutor. Your own fortune will make you independent of the So- 
ciety’s aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking 
your promise and deserting the band you engaged to join.” 

Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal prom- 
ise or enlered into any engagement; and this language was all much too 
hard and much too despotic for the occasion. I replied,—~ 

“There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the 
case, I am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially 
with strangers. With you I would have ventured much, because I ad- 
mire, confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, 
go when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate.” 

“Ah! you are afraid of yourself!” he said, curling his lip. 

“Tam. God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you 
wish me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing 
suicide. Moreover, before I definitely resolve on quitting England, I 
will know for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining 
in it than hv leaving it”

“What do you mean?” 

“Tt would be fruitless to attempt lo explain; but there is a point on 
which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by 
some means that doubt is removed.” 

“T know where your heart turns and to what it clings. The interest 
you cherish is lawless and unconsecrated. Long since you ought to have 
crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it, You think of Mr, 
Rochester?” 

Tt was true. I confessed it by silence. 

“Are you going to seck Mr. Rochester?” 

“YT must find out what is become of him.” 

“Tt remains for me, then,” he said, “to remember you in my prayers, 
and to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed 
become a castaway. I had thought I recognized in you one of the chog- 
en. Bul God sees not as man sees: His will be done!” 

We opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the 
glen. He was soon out of sight. 

On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, 
looking very thoughtful. Diana was a great deal taller than I; she put 
her hand on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face. 

“Jane,” she said, “you are always agitated and pale now. T am sure 
there is something the matter. Tell me what business St. John and you 
have on hands. I have watched you this half hour from the window; 
you must forgive my heing such a spy, but for a long time I have 
fancied I hardly know what. St. John is a strange being-—~-” 

She paused—I did not speak. Soon she resumed— 

“That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort re- 
specling you, I am sure, He has long distinguished you by a notice and 
interest he never showed to any one else—Lo what end? 1 wish he loved 
you—does he, Jana?” 

T put. her cool hand to my hot forchead: “No, Die, not one whit,” 

“Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so fre- 
quently alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side? Mary 
and I had both concluded he wished you to marry him.” 

“Te doegs—he has asked me to be his wife.” 

Diana clapped her hands, “That is just what we hoped and thought! 
And you will matry him, Jane, won't you? And then he will slay in 
England.” 

“Fay from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is Lo procure 
a filting [ellow-labourer in his Inclian toils.” 

“What! He wishes you to go to India?” 

Vas,” 

“Madness!” she exclaimed. “You would not live three months there, 


JANE EYRE 359 


Zam certain, You never shall go. You have not consented, have you, 
Jane?” 

“T have refused to marry him-——” 

“And have consequently displeased him?” she suggested. 

“Decply; he will never forgive me, I fear. Yet I offered to ac- 
company him as his sister.” 

“It was frantic folly to do so, Jane. Think of the task you under- 
took—one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong, and 
you are weak. St. John—you know him—would urge you to impossibil- 
ities: wilh him there would be no permission to rest during the hot 
hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you force 
yourself to perform. I am astonished you found couzage to refuse his 
hand. You do not love him then, Jane?” 

“Not as a husband.” 

“Vet he is a handsome fellow.” 

“And I am so plain, you see, Die. We should never suit.” 

“Plain! You? Not at all. You are much too pretty, as well as too 
good, to be grilled alive in Calcutta.” And again she earnestly conjured 
me to give up all thoughts of going out with her brother. 

“I must indeed,” I said; “for when just now I repeated the offer of 
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of 
decency. Ele seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in pro- 
posing to accompany him unmarried—as if I had not from the first 
hoped to find in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such.” 

“What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?” 

“You should hear himself on the subject. He has again and again ex- 
plained that it is not himself, but his office, he wishes to mate, Fle has 
told me I am formed for labour, not for love—which is true, no doubt. 
But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that I am not 
formed for marriage. Would it not be strange, Die, to be chained for 
life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?” 

“Insupportable—unnatural—out of the question!” 

“And then,” I continued, “though I have only sisterly affection for 
him now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of 
conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him, be- 
cause he is so talented, and there is often a certain heroic grandeur in 
his look, manner, and conversation. In that case, my lot would become 
unspeakably wretched. He would not want me to love him; and if I 
showed the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity, 
unrequired by him, unbecoming in me. I know he would.” 

“And yet St. John is a good man,” said Diana. 

“He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings 
and claims of liltle people, in pursuing his own large views. It is bet- 


360 JANE EYRE 


ter, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in his 
progress, he should trample them down. Here he comes! I will leave 
you, Diana.” And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden, 

But I was forced to meet him again at supper. During that meal he 
appeared just as composed ag usual. I had thought he would hardly 
speak Lo me, and J was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matri- 
monial scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points, He 
addressed me precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, 
been his ordinary manner—one scrupulously polite. No doubt he had 
invoked the help of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused 
in him, and now believed he had forgiven me once more. 

Yor the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first 
chapter of Revelation. It was at all Limes pleasant to listen while from 
his lips fell the words of the Bible—never did his fine voice sound at 
once so sweet and full—~never did his manner become so impressive in 
iis noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God; and to- 
night that voice took a more solemn tone—that manner a more thrilling 
meaning—as he sat in the midst of his houschold circle (the May moon 
shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost un- 
necessary the light of the candle on the table)—as he sat there, bending 
over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision of the 
new heaven and the new earth—+told how God would come to dwell with 
men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised 
that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any 
more pain, because the former things were passed away, 

The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them—espec- 
ially as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in 
uttering them, his eye had turned on me. 

“We that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, 
and he shall be my son, But,” was slowly, distinctly read, “the fearful, 
the unbelicying, ete., shall have their part in the lake which burneth 
with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.” 

Henceforward I knew what fate St. John feared for me. 

A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked 
his enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter, The reader 
believed his name was already wrilien in the Lamb’s book of life, and 
he yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which 
the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need 
of sun or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and 
the Lamb is the light thereof. 

In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered—~all his 
stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and re- 
solved on a conquest. He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; 


JANE EYRE 362 


guidance for wanderers from the fold; a return, even at the eleventh 
hour, for those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were 
luring from the narrow path. He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon 
of a brand snatched from the burning. Earnestness is ever deeply sol- 
emn: first, as I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when 
it continued and rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed. He felt the 
greatness and goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard 
him plead for it, could not but feel it too. 

The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early 
hour in the morning. Diana and Mary, having kissed him, left the room 
—in compliance, I think with a whispered hint from him. I tendered 
my hand, and wished him a pleasant journey. 

“Thank you, Jane. As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a fort- 
night: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection, If I listened to 
human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me; but I 
listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim—to do all 
things to the glory of God. My Master was long-suffering: so will I be. 
I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath: repent—resolve, 
while there is yet time. Remember, we are bid to work while it is day— 
warned that ‘the night cometh when no man shall work.’ Remember the 
fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life. God give you 
strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken from you!” 

He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words. He had 
spoken earnestly, mildly; his look was not, indeed, that of a lover, be- 
holding his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering 
sheep—or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is 
responsible. All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not— 
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots—provided only they be 
sincere—have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule. I felt 
veneration for St. John—veneration so strong that its impetus thrust 
Me at once to the point I had so long shunned. I was tempted to cease 
struggling with him—to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf of 
his existence, and there lose my own. I was almost as hard beset by him 
now as I had been once before in a different way, by another. I was a 
fool both times To have yielded then would have been an error of 
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment. 
So I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet 
medium, of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant. 

I stood motionless under my hierophant’s touch. My refusals were 
forgotten—-my fears overcome—my wrestlings paralyzed. The Impos- 
sible—that is, my marriage with St. John—was fast becoming the Pos- 
sible. All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep. Religion called— 
angels beckoned—God commanded—life rolled together like a scroll—~ 


362 JANE EYRE 


death’s gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that for 
safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second. The dim 
roam was full of visions. 

“Could you decide now?” asked the missionary. The inquiry was put 
in gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently. Oh, that gentleness! how 
far more potent is it than force! T could resist St, John’s wrath: I grew 
pliant as a reed under his kindness. Yet 1 knew, all the time, if I yield. 
ed now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my former 
rebellion. Eis nature was not changed by one hour of solemn prayer; 
it was only elevated. 

“T could decide if I were but certain,” I answered. “Were I but con- 
vinced that it is God’s will I should marry you, I could vow to marry 
you here and now-——come afterwards what would!” 

“My prayers are heard!’’ ejaculated St. John. He pressed his hand 
firmer on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, 
amasé as if he loved me (I say alnost—I knew the difference, for I had 
felt what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of 
the question, and thought only of duty). I contended with my inward 
dimness of vision, before which clouds yet rolled. I sincerely, deeply, 
fervently longed Lo do what was right—and only that. “Show me, show 
me the path!” T entreated of Heaven. I was excited more than I had 
ever been, and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the 
reader shall judge. 

All the house was still: for I believe all, except St. John and myself, 
were now relired to rest. The one candle was dying out; the room was 
full of moonlight. My heart beat fast and quick: I heard its throb. 
Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible fecling that thrilled it through, 
and passed at once to my head and extremities, The feeling was not like 
an electric shock, but it was quit: as sharp, as strange, as startling: it 
acted on my senses ag if their utmost activity hitherto had been but 
torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced io wake. They 
rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my bones, 

“What have you heard? what do you see?” ask St. John, 1 saw noth- 
ing, but I heard a voice somewhere cry, —~ 

“Jane! Jane! Jane!”—nothing more. 

“QO God! what is itr” I gasped. 

I might have said, “Where is it?” for it did not seem in the room— 
nor in the house~-nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air—nor 
from under the earth—nor from overhead. I had heard it-—where, or 
whence, for ever impossible to know! And it was the voice of a human 
heing—a known, loved, well-remembered voice—that of Edward Fair- 
fax Rochester; and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently. 

“f am coming!” I cried. “Wait for me! Qh, I will come;” I flew to 


JANE EYRE 363 


the door, and looked into the passage: it was dark, I ran out into the 
garden: it was void. 

“Where are you?” I exclaimed. 

The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back—Where 
are your” I listened. The wind sighed low in the firs; all was moorland 
loneliness and midnight hush. 

“Down superstition!” I commented, as that spectre rose up black by 
the black yew at the gate. “This is not thy deception, nor thy witch- 
craft; it is the work of nature, She was roused, and did—no miracle— 
but her best.” 

I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained 
me. It was my time to assume ascendency. My powers were in play and 
in force. I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to 
leave me; I must and would be alone. He obeyed at once, Where there 
is energy to command well enough, obedience never fails. I mounted to 
my chamber; locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my 
way—a different way from St, John’s, but effective in its own fashion. I 
seemed to penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out 
in gratitude at His feet. I rose from the thanksgiving—took a resolve 
—and lay down, unscared, enlightened—eager but for the daylight, 


CHAPTER XXXVI 


Tar daylight came. I rose at dawn. I busied myself for an hour or two 
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the 
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence, 
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room. He stopped at my door. I 
feared he would knock—no, but a slip of paper was passed under the 
door. I took it up. It bore these words:— 

“You left me too suddenly last night. Had you stayed but a little 
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian’s cross and the 
angel’s crown. I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day 
fortnight. Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into tempta- 
tion: the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak, I shall 
pray for you hourly.—Yours, St. Joun.” 

“My spirit,” I answered mentally, “is willing to do what is right; and 
my flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of heaven, 
when once that will is distinctly known to me. At any rate, it shall be 
strong enough to search—inquire—to grope an outlet from this cloud 
of doubt, and find the open day of certainty.” 

It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly—~ 
rain beat fast on my casement, I heard the front-door open, and St. 


364 JANE EVRE 


John pass out. Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the 
garden. He took the way over the misty moors in the direction of 
Whitcross—there he would meet the coach. 

“In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin,” 
thought I; “I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross. 1 too have some 
to see and ask after in England, before I depart for ever.” 

It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. I filled the interval in 
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had 
given my plans their present bent. I recalled that inward sensation I 
had experienced; for I could recall it, with its unspeakable strangeness, 
I recalled the voice I had heard. Again 1 questioned whence it came, as 
vainly as before: it seemed in #tc—not in the external world. I asked 
was it a mere nervous impression—a delusion? I could not conceive or 
believe: it was more like an inspiration. The wondrous shock of feel- 
ing had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations of Paul 
and Silas’s prison; it had opened the doors of the soul’s cell and loosed 
iis bands—it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence il sprang trem- 
bling, listening, aghast; then vibraled thrice a cry on my startled car, 
and in my quaking heart, and through my spirit, which neither feared 
nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of onc effort it had 
been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous body, 

“Ere many days,” I said, as L terminated my musings, “I will know 
something of him whose voice seemed last night Lo summon me. Letters 
have proved of no avail—personal inquiry shall replace them.” 

At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a 
journey, and should be absent at least four days. 

“Alone, Jance” they asked. 

“Yas; it was to sce or hear news of a friend about whom I had for 
some time been uneasy.” 

They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they 
had believed me to be without any friends save them-—for, indeed, I 
had often said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained 
{rom comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well 
enough to travel, I looked very pale, she observed. I replied that 
nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind, which [ hoped soon to alleviate. 

It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled 
with no inquiries—no surmises. Having once explained to them that I 
could not now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely ac- 
quiesced in the silence with which I pursued them, according to me the 
privilege of free action I should under similar circumstances have ac- 
corded them, 

T left Moor House at three o’clock p.m., and soon after four I stood 
at the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the 


JANE EYRE 365 


coach which was to take me to distant Thornfield. Amidst the silence of 
those solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great 
distance. It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one 
summer evening on this very spot—how desolate, and hopeless, and ob- 
jectless! It stopped as I beckoned. I entered—not now obliged to part 
with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation. Once more 
on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home. 

Tt was a journey of six-and-thirty hours. I had set out from Whit- 
cross on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday 
morning the coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situ- 
ated in the midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and 
low pastoral Wills (how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared 
with the stern North-Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the 
lineaments of a once familiar face, Ves, I knew the character of this 
landscape: I was sure we were near my bourne. 

“How far is Thornfield Hall from here?” I asked of the hostlex. 

“Just two miles, ma’am, across the fields.” 

“My journey is closed,” I thought to myself. I got out of the coach, 
gave a box I had into the hostler’s charge to be kept till I called for it; 
paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going. The brightening 
day gleamed on thé sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, “The 
Rochester Arms,” My heart leapt up: I was already on my master’, 
very lands. It fell again: the thought struck it:— 

“Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught 
you know; and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you 
hasten, who besides him is there? His lunatic wife: and you have noth- 
ing to do with him; you dare not speak to him or seek his presence. 
You have lost your labour; you had better go no farther,” urged the 
monitor. “Ask information of the people at the inn; they can give you 
all you seek—they can solve your doubts at once, Go up to that man, 
and inquire if Mr. Rochester be at home.” 

The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act 
on it—I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair. To pro- 
Jong doubt was to prolong hope. I might yet once more see the Hall un- 
der the ray of her star. There was the stile before me—the very fields 
through which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful 
fury tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: 
ere I well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of 
them. How fast I walked! How I ran sometimes! How I looked for- 
ward to catch the first view of the well-known woods! With what feel- 
ings I welcomed single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow 
and hill between them! 

At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing 


366 JANE EVRE 


broke the morning stillness. Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened. 
Another field crossed—a lane threaded—and there were the courtyard 
walls—the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid. “My first 
view of it shall be in front,” I determined, “where its bold battlements 
will strike {he cye nobly at once, and where I can single oul my master’s 
very window; perhaps he will be standing at it—he rises early; per- 
haps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in front. 
Jould I but see him!—but a moment! Surely, in that case, I should not 
be so mad as to run lo him? I cannot tell—I am not certain. And if 
did—what then? God bless him! What then? Who would be hurt by 
my once more lasting the life his glance can give me? I rave: perhaps 
at this moment he is watching the sun rise over ithe Pyrenees, or on the 
tideless sca of the south.” 

T had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard—turned its angle: 
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two 
slone pillars crowned by stone balls, From behind one pillar 1 could 
peep round quietly at the full front of the mansion. I advanced my 
head with precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bed-room window- 
blinds were yet drawn up: batUements, windows, long front—all from 
this sheltered station were al my command. 

The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this 
survey, I wonder what they thought. They must have considered I was 
very caeful and limid at first, and that gradually I grew very hold and 
reckless. A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my 
niche and a straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in 
front of the great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it, 
“What affectation of diffidence was this at first,” they might have de- 
manded; “what stupid regardlessness now?” 

Hear an illustration, reader. 

A lover finds his misiress asleep on a mossy bank, He wishes to catch 
a glimpse of her tair face withoul waking her. He sleals softly over the 
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses—fancying she has stirred: 
he withdraws—not for worlds would he be scen, All is still: he again 
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he lifts 
it, bends lower; now his cyes anticipate the vision of beauty—warm, 
and blooming, and lovely, in rest. [low hurried was their first glance! 
But how they fix! How he starts! How he suddenly and vehemently 
clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with 
his finger! How he calls aloud a name, and drop his burden, and gazes 
on it wildly! He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer 
fears to waken by any sound he can ulter—by any movement he can 
make, He thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead! 


JANE EYRE 367 


I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened 
ruin! 

No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed—to peep up at cham- 
ber lattices, fearing life was astir behind them! No nced to listen for 
doors opening—to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel walk! The 
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste; the portal yawned void, The 
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a shell-like wall, very 
high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no 
roof, no battlements, no chimneys—all had crashed in. 

And there was the silence of death about it, the solitude of a lone- 
some wild. No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never 
received an answer: as well dispatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle. 
The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen— 
by conflagration, But how kindled? What story belonged to this dis- 
aster? What loss, besides mortar and marble and woodwork, had fol- 
lowed upon it? Had life been wrecked as well as property? If so, 
whose? Dreadful question: there was no one here to answer it—not 
even dumb sign, mute token. 

In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated 
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late occur- 
rence, Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch, 
winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the 
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation—grass and 
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters. And 
oh! where, meantime, was the hapless owner of this wreck? In what 
land? under what auspices? My eye involuntarily wandered to the gray 
church tower near the gates, and I asked, “Is he with Damer de Roch- 
ester, sharing the shelter of his narrow marble house?” 

Some answer must be had to these questions, I could find it nowhere 
but at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned. The host himself 
brought my breakfast into the parlour, I requested him to shut the 
door and sit down—-I had some questions to ask him. But when he com- 
plied, I scarcely knew how to begin, such horror had I of the possible 
answers. And vet the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared 
me in a measure for a tale of misery. The host was a respectable- 
looking, middle-aged man, 

“Vou know Thornfield Hall, of course?” I managed to say at last. 

“Ves, ma’am; I lived there once.” 

“Did you?” Not in my time, I thought; you are a stranger to me. 

“I was the late Mr. Rochester’s butler,” he added. 

The late! I secm to have received, with full force, the blow I had 
been trying to evade. 

“The late!” I gasped. “Is he dead?” 


368 JANE EYRE 


“T mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward’s father,” he explained. 
I breathed again; my blood resumed its flow. Fully assured by these 
words that Mr, Edward—my Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever 
he was!)—was at least alive—was, in short, “the present gentleman.” 
Gladdening words! It seemed I could hear all that was to come—what- 
ever the disclosures might be—with comparative tranquillity. Since he 
was not in the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the 
Antipodes. 

“Ig Mr. Rochester living at Thornficld Hall now?” I asked, knowing, 
of course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the 
direct question as to where he really was. 

“No, ma’am—oh no! No one is living there. I suppose you are a 
stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last 
autumn. Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burned just about 
harvest-time, A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantily of valu- 
able property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved, 
‘The fire broke out at dead of night; and before the engines arrived from 
Millcoie, the building was one mass of flame. It was a terrible spectacle, 
I witressed it myself.” 

“At dead of night!" I muttered. Yes, that was ever the hour of fatal. 
ity at Thornfield, “Was it known how it originated?” I demanded. 

“They guessed, ma’am—they guessed. Indeed, I should say it was 
ascertained beyond a doubt. You are not perhaps aware,” he con- 
tinued, cdging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, “that 
there was a lady-——a—a lunatic, kept in the house?” 

“T have heard something of it.” 

“She was kept in very close confinement, ma’am; people even for 
some years was nol absolutely certain of her existence. No one saw 
her: they only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and 
who ot what she was it was difficult to conjecture. They said Mr, 
Edward had brought her from abroad, and some believed she had been 
his mistress. But a queer thing happened a year since—-a very queer 
thing.” 

I feared now to hear my own story, I endeavoured to recall him to 
the main fact. 

“And this lady?” 

“This lady, ma’am,” he answered, “turned out to be Mr. Rochester's 
wife! The discovery was brought about in the strangest way. There 
was a young lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in 

tr 


“But the fire,” I suggested. 
“I’m coming lo that, ma’am-——that Mr, Edward fell in love with. The 
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was 


JANE EYRE 369 


after her continually. They used to watch him-—servants will, you 
know, ma’am—~and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody 
but him thought her so very handsome, She was a little small thing, 
they say, almost like a child. I never saw her myself; but I've heard 
Leah, the housemaid, tell of her. Leah liked her well enough. Mr. 
Rochester was about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, 
when gentlemen of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as 
if they were bewitched. Well, he would marry her.” 

“You shall tell me this part of the story another time,” I said; “but 
now I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire. 
Was it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?” 

“Vou've hit it, ma’am: it’s quite certain that it was her, and nobody 
but her, that set it going. She had a woman to take care of her called 
Mrs. Poole—an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for 
one fault-~-a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons—she 
kept a private bottle of gin by her, and now and then took a drop over- 
much. It is excusable, for she had a hard life of it. But still it was 
dangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, 
the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out 
of her pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the 
house, doing any wild mischief that came into her head. They say she 
had nearly burnt her husband in his bed once; but I don’t know about 
that. However, on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the 
room next her own, and then she got down to a lower story, and made 
her way to the chamber that had been the governess’s—-(she was like as 
if she knew somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her) 
—and she kindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, 
fortunately. The governess had run away two months before; and for 
all Mr. Rochester sought her as if she had been the most precious thing 
he had in the world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew 
savage—quite savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, 
but he got dangerous after he lost her. He would be alone, too. He sent 
Mrs, Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he 
did it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she 
deserved it—she was a very good woman, Miss Adéle, a ward he had, 
was put to school. He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and 
shut himself up like a hermit at the Hall.” 

“What! did he not leave England?” 

“Leave England? Bless you, no! He would not cross the door. 
stones of the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghosy 
about the grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses—which 
it is my opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman 
than he was before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never 


370 JANE EVRE 


saw, ma’am. He was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as 
some are, and he was not so very handsome; but he had a courage and 
a will of his own, if ever man had. I knew him from a hoy, you sce: and 
for my part, I have often wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the 
sea hefore she came to Thornfield Hall.” 

“Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?” 

“Ves, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burn- 
ing above and below, and got the servants out of their beds, and helped 
them down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell. 
And then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she 
was standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting 
out till they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with 
my own cye, She was a big woman, and had long black hair; we could 
see it streaming against the flames as she stood. I witnessed, and sev- 
eral more witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the skylight on to 
the roof; we heard him call, ‘Bertha!’ We saw him approach her; and 
then, ma’am, she yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay 
smashed on the pavement.” 

“Dead?” 

“Dead! Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were 
scattered,” 


“Good God!” 
“You may well say so, ma’am; it. was frightful!” 
He shuddered, 


“And afterwards?” I urged. 

“Well, ma’am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground; there 
are only same bits of walls standing now.” 

“Were any other lives lost?” 

“No; perhaps it would have been better if there had.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Poor Mr. Edward!” he ejaculated, “I little thought ever to have 
seen it] Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first 
marriage secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one liv- 
ing; but I pity him, for my part.” 

“You said he was alive?” I exclaimed. 

“Yes, yes, he is alive; but many think he had better be dead.” 

“Why? How?” My blood was again running cold. “Where is he?” 
I demanded. “Ts he in England?” 

“Ay-—ay—he’s in England; he can’t get out of England, I fancy— 
he’s a fixture now.” 

What agony was this! And the man seemed resolved to protract it. 

“Fe is stone-blind,” he said at last. “Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr. 
Edward.” 


JANE EYRE 371 


I had dreaded worse—I had dreaded he was mad. I summoned 
strength to ask what had caused this calamity. 

“Tt was all his own courage, and a body may say his kindness, in a 
way, ma’am: he wouldn’t leave the house till every one else was out 
before him. As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. 
Rochester had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great 
crash—all fell. He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly 
hurt: a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one 
eye was knocked oul, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the 
surgeon, had to amputate it directly. The other eye inflamed; he lost 
the sight of that also, He is now helpless, indeed—blind and a cripple.” 

“Where is he? Where does he now live?” 

“At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off 
—quile a desolate spot.” 

“Who is with him?” 

“Old John and his wife: he would have none else. He is quite broken 
down, they say.” 

“Have you any sort of conveyance?” 

“We have a chaise, ma’am, a very handsome chaise.” 

“Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to 
Ferndean before dark this day, I’ll pay both you and him twice the hire 
you usually demand.” 


CHAPTER XXXVII 


Te manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity, 
moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood. 
I had heard of it before. Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and some- 
times went there. His father had purchased the estate for the sake of 
the game covers. He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, 
in consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site. Ferndean then re- 
mained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two 
or three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he 
went there in the season to shoot, 

To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the 
characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small, penetrating 
rain, The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and 
driver with the double remuneration I had promised. Even when within 
a very short distance of the manor-house you could see nothing of it, so 
thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it. Iron 
gates between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing 
through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked 
trees. There was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle be- 


372 JANE EYRE 


tween hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches. I followed it, 
expecting soon to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it 
wound far and farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible. 

J thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way. The dark- 
ness of natural as well as of silvan dusk gathered over me. I looked 
round in search of another road. There was none: all was interwoven 
stem, columnar trunk, dense summer foliage—no opening anywhere, 

T proceeded. At last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; pres- 
ently I beheld a railing, then the house—scarce, by this dim light, dis- 
tinguishable from the trees, so dank and green were its decaying walls. 
Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of 
enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle. 
There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk gird- 
ling a grass plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest. The 
house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were Jat. 
ticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it. 
The whole looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, “quite 
a desolate spot.” It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pat- 
fering rain on the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its 
vicinage, 

“Can there be life here?” I asked. 

Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement—that nar. 
vow front door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from 
the grange. 

It opened slowly. A figure came oul into the twilight and stood on 
the step—a man without a hat. He stretched forth his hand as if to 
feel whether it rained. Dusk as it was, I had recognized him—it was my 
master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other. 

T stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood Lo watch him—to ex- 
amine him, myself unseen, and, alas! to him invisible. It was a sudden 
meeting, and one in which raplure was kept well in check by pain, I 
had no difficully in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step 
from hasty advance, 

His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his 
port was still erecl, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features 
altered or sunk: nol in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his 
alhletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted, But in his 
countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding— 
that reminder me of some wronged and fetlered wild beast or bird, 
dangerous to approach in his sullen woe, The caged eagle, whose gold- 
ringed eyes cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless 
Samson, 

And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity? If you 


JANE EYRE 373 


do. you little know me. A soft hope blent with my sorrow that soon I 
should dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so 
sternly sealed beneath it; but not yet. I would not accost him yet. 

Tle descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly to- 
wards the grass-plat. Where was his daring stride now? Then he 
paused, as if he knew not which way to turn. He lifted his hand and 
opened his eyelids; gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, 
and towards the amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void 
darkness. He stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, 
he kept hidden in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an 
idea of what lay around him. He met but vacancy still; for the trees 
were some yards off where he stood. He relinquished the endeavour, 
folded his arms, and stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast 
on his uncovered head. At this moment John approached him from 
some quarter. 

“Will you take my arm, sit?” he said. “There is a heavy shower 
coming on; had you not better go in?” 

“Let me alone,” was the answer. 

John withdrew without having observed me. Mr. Rochester now tried 
to walk about: vainly,—all was too uncertain. He groped his way back 
to the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door. 

I now drew near and knocked. John’s wife opened for me. ‘‘Mary,” 
T said, “how are you?” 

She started as if she had seen a ghost. I calmed her. To her hur- 
ried ‘Is it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?” 
I answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kit- 
chen, where John now sat by a good fire. I explained to them, in few 
words, that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thorn- 
field, and that I was come to see Mr. Rochester. I asked John to go 
down to the turnpike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring 
my trunk, which I had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet 
and shawl, I questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated 
at the Manor House for the night; and finding that arrangements to 
that effect, though difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I 
should stay. Just at this moment the parlour-bell rang. 

“When you go in,” said I, “tell your master that a person wishes to 
speak to him, but do not give my name.” 

“T don’t think he will see you,” she answered; “he refuses every- 
body.” 

When she returned I inquired what he had said. 

“You are to send in your name and your business,” she replied. She 
then proceeded to fill a glass with water, and place it on a tray, to- 
gether with candles, 


394 JANE EYRE 


“Ts that what he rang for?” I asked. 

“Ves; he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind.” 

“Give the tray to me; I will carry it in.” 

TI took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door. The 
tray shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck 
my ribs loud and fast, Mary opened the door for me, and shut jt be- 
hind me. 

This parlour looked gloomy. A neglected handful of fire burnt low 
in the grate; and Icaning over it, with his head supported against the 
high, old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room. 
His old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled 
up as if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon. Pilot pricked up 
his ears when I came in; then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, 
and bounded towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands. 
I set it on the table; then patted him, and said softly, “Lie down!” Mr. 
Rochester turned mechanically to see what the commotion was; but as 
he saw nothing, he returned and sighed, 

“Give me the water, Mary,” he said. 

f approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed 
mie, still excited. 

“What is the matter?” he inquired, 

“Down, Pilot!” I again said, He checked the water on its way to his 
lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down. “This is 
you, Mary, is it not?” 

“Mary is in the kitchen,” I answered. 

He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I 
stood, he did not touch me, “Who is this? Who is this?” he demanded, 
trying, as it seemed, to see with those sightless cyes—~unavailing and 
distressing attempt! “Answer me—speak again!” he ordered imperi- 
ously and aloud. 

“Will you have a little more water, sir? I spilt half of what was in the 
glass,” I said, 

“Who is it? What is it? Who speaks?” 

“Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here. I came only 
this evening,” [ answered. 

“Great God!—what delusion has come over me? What sweet mad- 
ness has seized me?” 

“No delusion—no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delu- 
sion, your health too sound for frenzy.” 

“And where is the speaker? Is it only a voice? Oh! I cannot see, but 
I must feel, or my heart will stop and ray brain burst. Whatever—who- 
ever you are-~be perceptible to the touch, or I cannot live!” 


JANE EYRE 375 


He groped. I arrested his wandering band, and prisoned it in both 
mine. 

“Her very fingers!” he cried—“her small, slight fingers! If so, there 
must be more of her.” 

The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my 
shoulder—neck—waist—I was entwined and gathered to him. 

“Ts it Jane? What is it? This is her shape—this is her size——” 

“And this her voice,” I added. ‘She is all here: her heart too. God 
bless you, sir! I am glad to be so near you again.” 

“Jane Eyre—Jane Eyre!” was all he said, 

“My dear master,” I answered, “I am Jane Eyre. I have found you 
out—I am come back to you.” 

“In truth?—in the flesh? My living Jane?” 

“You touch me, sir-—you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold 
like a corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?” 

“My living darling! These are certainly her limbs, and these her 
features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery. It is a dream, 
such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more 
to my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus-—-and felt that she 
loved me, and trusted that she would not leave me.” 

“Which I never will, sir, from this day.” 

“Never will, says the vision? But I always woke and found it an 
empty mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned—my life dark, 
lonely, hopeless—my soul athirst, and forbidden to drink—my heart 
famished, and never to be fed. Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms 
now, you will fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you. But kiss 
me before you go—embrace me, Jane.” 

“There, sir—and there!” 

T pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes—I swept 
his hair from his brow, and kissed that too, He suddenly seemed to 
rouse himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him. 

“It is you—is it, Jane? You are come back to me, then?” 

“y am.” 

“And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream? And you 
are not 4 pining outcast amongst strangers?” 

“No, sir; I am an independent woman now.” 

“Independent! What do you mean, Jane?” 

“My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds.” 

“Ah! this is practical—this is real!” he cried; “I should never dream 
that. Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and 
piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into it. 
~-What, Janet! are you an independent woman? A rich woman?” 

“Quite rich, sir. If you won’t let me live with you, I can build a 


376 JANE EYRE 


house of my own close up to your door, and you may come and sit in 
my parlour when you want company of an evening.” 

“But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no douht, friends who will 
fook after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter 
dike mer” 

“T told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own 
mnistress,”” 

“And you will stay with me?” 

“Certainly—unless you object. I will be your neighbour, your nurse, 
your housekeeper. I find you lonely: [ will be your companion—to read 
ta you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes 
and hands to you. Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you 
shall not be left desolate, so long as I live.” 

He replied not. He seemed serious—abstracied. He sighed; he half- 
opened his lips as if to speak; he closed them again. I felt a little em- 
barrassed. Perhaps I had too rashly overleaped conventionalities; and 
he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness. I had in- 
deed made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me 
to be his wife—an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, 
bad buoyed me up that he would claim me at once as his own. But no 
hint to that effect escaping him, and his countenance becoming more 
avercast, I suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and 
was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to with- 
draw myself from his arms—but he eagerly snatched me closer. 

“No--no—Jane! you must not go, No~TI have touched you, heard 
you, felt the comfort of your presence, the sweetness of your consola~ 
tion: I cannol give up these joys. I have little left in myself—I must 
have you. The world may laugh—may call me absurd, selfish—but it, 
does not signify, My very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it 
will take deadly vengeance on its frame.” 

“Well, six, I wiil siay with you—I have said so.” 

“Ves—but you understand one thing by staying with me, and T un- 
derstand another. You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about 
my hand and chair—lo wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have 
an affectionate hearl and a generous spirit, which prompt you Lo make 
sacrifices for those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me, no 
doubt. I suppose I should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for 
you: do you think so? Come—tell me.” 

“Y will think what you like, sir. I am content to be only your nurse, 
if you think it better,” 

“But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young—you 
Must marry one day.” 

“T don’t care about being married,” 


JANE EVRE 377 


“You should care, Janet. If I were what I once was, I would try to 
make you care—but—a sightless block!” 

He relapsed again into gloom. I, on the contrary, became more cheer» 
ful, and took fresh courage. These last words gave me an insight as to 
where the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite 
relieved from my previous embarrassment. I resumed a livelier vein of 
conversation, 

“It is time some one undertook to rehumanize you,” said I, parting 
his thick and long uncut locks; “for I see you are being metamorphosed 
into a lion, or something of that sort. You have a ‘faux air’ of Nebu- 
chadnezzar in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds 
me of eagles’ feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds’ claws or 
not, I have not yet noticed.” 

“On this arm I have neither hand nor nails,” he said, drawing the 
mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me, “It is a mere 
stump—a ghastly sight! Don’t you think so, Jane?” 

“Tt is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes—and the scar of 
fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving 
you too well for all this, and making too much of you.” 

“T thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm and 
my cicatrized visage.” 

“Did you? Don't tell me so, lest I should say something disparaging 
to your judgment. Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better 
fire, and have the hearth swept up. Can you tell when there is a good 
fire?” 

“Ves; with the right eye I see a glow—a ruddy haze.” 

“And you see the candles?” 

“Very dimly—each is a luminous cloud.” 

“Can you see me?” 

“No, my fairy; but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you.” 

“When do you take supper?” 

“T never take supper.” 

“But you shall have some to-night. I am hungry; so are you, I dare 
say, only you forget.” 

Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order; I 
prepared him, likewise, a comfortable repast. My spirits were excited, 
and with pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper,-and for a 
long time after. There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee 
and vivacity with him; for with him J was at perfect ease, because I 
knew I suited him: all I said or did seemed either to console or revive 
him. Delightful consciousness! It brought to life and light my whole 
nature: in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine. Blind 


378 JANE EYRE 


as he was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead; his 
lincaments sofLened and warmed. 

After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had 
been, what I had heen doing, how I had found him out. But I gave him 
only very partial replics—it was too late to enter into particulars that 
night. Besides, I wished lo touch no deep-thrilling chord—to open no 
fresh well of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer 
him. Cheered, as I have said, he was; and yet but by fits. If a mo- 
ment’s silence broke the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, 
then say, “Jane.” 

“Vou are altogether a human being, Jane? You are certain of that?” 

“T conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester.” 

“Vet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly 
tise on my lone hearth? I stretched my hand to take a glass of water 
from a hireling, and it was given me by you; I asked a question ex- 
pecting John’s wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear.” 

“Because I had come in, in Mary’s stead, with the tray.” 

“And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with 
you. Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on 
for months past?-—~doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in 
day; feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of 
hunger when I forgot to cat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, 
a very delirium of desire to behold my Jane again. Yes; for her restor- 
ation I longed, far more than for that of my lost sight. How can it be 
that Jane is with me, and says she loves me? Will she not depart as 
suddenly as she came? To-morrow, I fear, I shall find her no more.” 

A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed 
ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this 
frame of mind. I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked 
that they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would 
tnake them grow as broad and black as ever. 

“Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, 
when, at some fatal moment, you will again desert me—~passing like a 
shadow, whilher and how to me unknown, and for me remaining after- 
wards undiscoverable?” 

“Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?” 

“What for, Jane?” 

“Yust to comb out this shaggy black mane. I find you rather alarm- 
ing, when I examine you close at hand. You talk of my being a fairy, 
but Tam sure you are more like a brownie,” 

“Am I hideous, Jane?” 

“Very, sir; you always were, you know.” 


JANE EYRE 379 


“Humph! The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever 
you have sojourned,” 

“Vel I have been with good people—far better than you—a hundred 
times betler people; possessed of ideas and views you never enter- 
tained in your life; quite more refined and exalted.” 

“Whom the deuce have you becn with?” 

“Tf you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair oul of your 
head, and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my sub- 
stantiality.” 

“Whom have you been with, Jane?” 

“You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir—you must wait till to- 
morrow; to leave my tale half told will, you know, be a sort of security 
that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it. By-the-bye, I 
must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of water then: I 
must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried ham.” 

“You mocking changeling—fairy-born and human-bred! You make 
me feel as I have not felt these twelve months. If Saul could have had 
you for his David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the 
aid of the harp.” 

“There, sir, you are redd up and made decent. Now I'll leave you. 
I have been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired. 
Good-night.” 

“Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you 
have been?” 

T laughed, and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs. “A 
good idea!” I thought with glee. "I see I have the means of fretting 
him out of his melancholy for some time to come.” 

Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering 
from one room to another. As soon as Mary came down I heard the 
question: “Is Miss Eyre here?” Then: “Which room did you put her 
into? Was it dry? Is she up? Go and ask if she wants anything, and 
when she will come down.” 

I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast, 
Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered 
my presence. It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of 
that vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity. He sat in his chair-—still, 
but not at rest—expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness 
marking his strong features. His countenance reminded one of a lamp 
quenched, waiting to be re-lit—and, alas! it was not himself that could 
now kindle the lustre of animated expression; he was dependent on an- 
other for that office! I had meant to be gay and careless, but the power- 
lessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I ac- 
costed him with what vivacity I could. 


380 JANE EYRE 


“Tt is a bright, sunny morning, sir,” I said. “The rain is over and 
wone, and there is a lender shining after it. You shall have a walk 
soon.” 

I had wakened the glow: his features beamed. 

“Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark! Come to me. You are not 
gone—not vanished? I heard one of your kind an hour ago singing high 
over the wood; but its song had no music for me, any more than the 
rising sun had rays, All the melody on earth is concentrated in my 
Jane’s tongue to my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one); all 
the sunshine I can feel is in her presence.” 

The water slood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; 
just as if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat 
a sparrow to become its purveyor. But I would not be lachrymose: I 
dashed off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast, 

Most of the morning was spent in the open air, L led him out of the 
wet and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how 
brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked re- 
freshed; how sparklingly blue was the sky. I sought a seat for him ina 
hidden and lovely spot—a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let 
him, when seated, place me on his knee. Why should I, when both he 
and I were happier near than apart? Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet. 
We broke out suddenly while clasping me in his arms--~ 

“Cruel, cruel deserter! Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered 
you had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, 
after examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no 
money, nor anything which could serve as an equivalent! A pearl neck- 
lace I had given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were 
Jeft corcled and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour, 
What could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless? And 
what did she do? Let me hear now.” 

Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year, 
I softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering 
and starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict 
unnecessary pain! the litle I did say lacerated his faithful heart deeper 
than I wished. 

I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of mak- 
ing my way; I should have told him my intention. I should have con- 
fided in him; he would never have forced me to be his mistress. Vio- 
Jent as he had seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far Loo well 
and too tenderly to conslitule himself my tyrant: he would have given 
me half his fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, 
rather than I should have flung myself friendless on the wide world. I 
had endured, he was certain, more than I had confessed to him. 


JANE EYRE 381 


“Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short,” I 
answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at 
Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, etc. The 
accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due 
order. Of course, St. John River’s name came in frequently in the prog- 
ress of my tale. When I had done, that name was immediately taken up. 

“This St. John, then, is your cousin?” 

(Veg? 

“You have spoken of him often: did you like him?” 

“Fle was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him.” 

“A good man, Does that mean a respectable, well-conducted man of 
fifty? Or what does it mean?” 

“St. John was only twenty-nine, sir.” 

“ “Jeune encore,’ as the French say. Is he a person of low stature, 
phlegmatic, and plain?—a person whose goodness consists rather in his 
guiltlessness of vice than in his prowess in virtue?” 

“He is untiringly active. Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to 
perform.” 

“But his brain? That is probably rather soft? He means well, but 
you shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?” 

“He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point, His brain 
is first-rate; I should think not impressible, but vigorous.” 

“Ts he an able man, then?” 

“Truly able.” 

“A thoroughly educated man?” 

“St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar,” 

“His manners, I think you said, are not to your taste?—priggish and 
parsonic?” 

“T never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, 
they must suil it—-they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike.” 

“His appearance——I forget what description you gave of his ap- 
pearance;—a sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neck- 
cloth, and stilted up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?” 

“St, John dresses well. He is a handsome man—tall, fair, with blue 
eyes, and a Grecian profile,” 

(Aside.) “Damn him!"—-(To me.) “Did you like him, Jane?” 

“Ves, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before.” 

I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor. Jealousy had 
got hold of him; she stung him. But the sting was salutary; it gave him 
respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy. I would not, therefore, 
immediately charm the snake, 

“Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss 
Eyre?” was the next somewhat unexpected observation, 


382 JANE EYRE 


“Why not, Mr. Rochester?” 

“The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a ‘athe too over- 
whelming contrast. Your words have delineated very prettily a grace- 
ful Apollo: he is present to your imagination—tall, fair, blue-eyed, and 
with a Grecian profile. Your eycs dwell on a Vulcan—a real black- 
smith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the bargain.” 

“T never thought of it before; but you certainly are rather like Vul- 
can, sir.” 

“Well, you can leave me, ma’am: but before you go” (and he re- 
taincd me by a firmer grasp than ever), “you will be pleased just to 
answer me a question or two.” He paused, 

“What questions, Mr. Rochester?” 

Then followed this cross-examination. 

“St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you 
were his cousin?” 

Ves”? 

“You would often see him? He would visit the school sometimes?” 

“Daily.” 

“He would approve of your plans, Jane? I know they would be 
clever, for you are a talented creature!” 

“He appreved of them—yes,” 

“Te would discover many things in you he could not have expected 
to find? Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary.” 

“YT don’t know about that.” 

“You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come 
there to see your” 

“Now and then,” 

“Of an evening?” 

“Once or twice.” 

A pause, 

“How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousin« 
ship was discovered?” 

“Tive months.” 

‘Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?” 

“Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the 
window, and we by the table.” 

“Did he study much?” 

“A goad deal,” 

“Whatp? 

“Sindostanec.” 

“And what did you do meantime?” 

“J leamt German, al first.” 

“Did he teach your” 


JANE EYRE 383 


“Fe did not understand German.” 

“Did he teach you nothing?” 

“A little Hindostanee.” 

“Rivers taught you Hindostanee?” 

“Ves, sir.” 

“And his sisters also?” 

“No.” 

“Only your” 

“Only me.” 

“Did you ask to learn?” 

No,” 

“Fe wished to teach you?” 

“Ves,” 

A second pause. 

“Why did he wish it? Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?” 

“Fe intended me to go with him to India.” 

“Ah! here I reach the root of the matter. He wanted you to marry 
him?” 

“He asked me to marry him.” 

“That is a fiction—an impudent invention to vex me,” 

“I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth, He asked me more than 
once, and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be.” 

“Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me. How often am I to say the 
same thing? Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, 
when I have given you notice to quit?” 

“Because I am comfortable there.” 

“No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not 
with me; it is with this cousin—this St. John. Oh, till this moment, I 
thought my little Jane was all mine! I had a belief she loved me even 
when she lef{ me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter. Long as 
we have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I 
never thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another} 
But it is useless grieving. Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers.” 

“Shake me off, then, sir—push me away, for I'll not leave you of my 
own accord,” 

“Jane, I ever like your tone of voice; it still renews hope, it sounds 
so truthful. When J hear it, it carries me back a year. I forget that 
you have formed a new tie. But I am not a fool—go———” 

“Where must I go, sir?” 

“Your own way—with the husband you have chosen.” 

“Who is that?” 

“Vou know—this St. John Rivers.” 

“He is not my husband, nor ever will be. He does not love me; I do 


384 JANE EYRE 


not love him. He loves (as he cas love, and that is not as you love) a 
beautiful young Jady called Rosamond, He wanted to marry me only 
because he thought I should make a suitable missionary’s wife, which 
she would not have done. He is good and great, but severe; and, for 
me, cold as an iccberg. He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his 
side, nor near him, nor with him. He has no indulgence for me—ne 
fondness. He sees nothing atiraclive in me; not even youth—only a 
few useful mental points——Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?” 

I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind 
but beloved master. Ie smiled. 

“What, Jane! Is this true? Is such really the state of matters be- 
tween you and Rivers?” 

“Absolutely, sir! Oh, you need not be jealous! I wanted to tease you 
a little, to make you less sad; I thought anger would be better than 
grief. But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I 
do love you, you would be proud and content, All my heart is yours, 
sir—it belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fale to exile 
the rest. of me from your presence for ever.” 

Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect. 

“My scared vision! my crippled strength!” he murmured tegret- 
fully. 

I caressed, in order to soothe him. I knew of what he was thinking, 
and wanted to speak for him, but dared not. As he turned aside his 
face a minute, I saw a Lear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and 
trickle down the manly cheek. My heart swelled. 

“Tam no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thorn- 
field orchard,” he remarked ere long. “And what right would that ruin 
have to bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?” 

“You are no ruin, sir—no lighining-struck tree; you are green and 
vigorous, Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or 
not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they 
grow they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your 
strength offers them so safe a prop.” 

Again he smiled: I gave him comfort. 

“You speak of friends, Jane?” he asked. 

“Ves, of friends,” I answered rather hesitatingly; for I knew I meant 
more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ. He 
helped me. 

“Ahl Jane. But I want a wife,” 

“Do you, sir?” 

“Yes; is it news to you?” 

“O£ course; you said nothing about it before.” 

“Ts it unwelcome news?” 


JANE EYRE 385 


“That depends on circumstances, sir—on your choice.” 

“Whick you shall make for me, Jane. I will abide by your decision.” 

“Choose then, sir—her who loves you best.” 

“T will at least choose—her J love best. Jane, will you marry me?” 

“Ves, sir.” 

“A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to 
wail onP” 

“Ves, sir.” 

“Truly, Jane?” 

“Most truly, sir.” 

“Q my darling! God bless you and reward you!” 

“Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life—if ever I 
thought a good thought—if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless 
prayer—if ever I wished a righteous wish, I am rewarded now. To be 
your wife is, for me, to be as happy as I can be on earth.” 

“Because you delight in sacrifice.” 

“Sacrifice! What do I sacrifice? Famine for food, expectation for 
content. To be privileged to put my arms round what I value—to press 
my lips to what I love—to repose on what I trust: is that to make a 
sacrifice? If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice.” 

“And to bear with my infirmities, Jane—to overlook my deficien- 
cies.” 

“Which are none, sir, to me. I love you better now, when I can really 
be useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when 
you disdained every part but that of the giver and protector.” 

“Flitherto I have hated to be helped—to be led; henceforth, I feel I 
shall hate it no more. I did not like to put my hand into a hireling’s; 
but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane’s little fingers. I preferred 
utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but Jane’s soft 
ministry will bé a perpetual joy. Jane suits me; do I suit her?” 

“To the finest fibre of my nature, sir.” 

“The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for; we 
must be married instantly.” 

He looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising. 

“We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane; there is but 
the license to get—then we marry.” 

“Mr, Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from 
its meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home for his dinner. Let me 
look at your watch,” 

“Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have 
no use for it.” 


386 JANE EVRE 


“Tt is nearly four o’clock in the afternoon, sir. Don’t you feel 
hungry?” 

“The third day from ths must he our wedding-day, Jane. Never 
mind fine clothes and jewels, now—all thal is nol worth a fillip.” 

“The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir. The breeze is still; it 
is quite hot.” 

“Do you know, Jane, I have your little pear! necklace al this mo- 
ment fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat? I have worn it 
since Lhe day I lost my only Lreasure, as a memento of her.” 

“We will go home through the wood; that will be the shadiest way.” 

Fie pursued his own thoughts without heeding me. 

“Janes you think me, I dare say, an irreligious dog; but my heart 
swells with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now. He 
sees not as man sves, but far clearer; judges not as man judges, bul for 
more wiscly. I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower— 
breathed guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me. I, in 
my sliffnecked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation; instead of 
bending to the decree, I defied iL. Divine justice pursued its course; 
disasters came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of 
the shadow of death. Hts chastisements are mighty; and one smote me 
which has humbled me for ever. You know I was proud of my strength: 
but what is it now, when 1 must give it over Lo foreign guidance, as a 
child does its weakness? Of late, Jane—only—only of Jate-—I began to 
see and acknowledge the hand of God in my doom, I began to experi- 
ence remorse, repentance; the wish for reconcilement Lo my Maker, I 
began sometimes to pray—very brief prayers they were, but very 
sincere, 

“Some days since-—nay, I can number them—four; it was last Mon- 
day night—a singular mood came over me; one in which grief replaced 
frenzy—sorrow, sullenness. I had long had Che impression that since I 
could nowhere find you, you must be dead, Late that night—perhaps it 
might he between eleven and twelve o’clock—ere I retired to my dreary 
rest, I supplicated God that, if it seemed good to Him, 1 might soon be 
taken from this life, and admitted to that world to come, where there 
was still hope of rejoining Jane. 

“T was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: 
it soothed me to feel the balmy night air; though I could sce no stars, 
and only by a vague, luminous haze knew the presence of a moon. f£ 
longed for thee, Janet! Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh| 
T asked of God, at once in anguish and humility if I had not been long 
enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and 
peace once more, That I merited all T endured, I acknowledged—that 
I could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of ,, 


JANE EYRE 387 


my heart’s wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words— 
‘Jane! Jane! Jane!’ ” 

“Did you speak these words aloud?” 

“T did, Jane. If any listener had heard me, he would have thought 
me mad, I pronounced them with such frantic energy.” 

“And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?” 

“Yes; bul the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange 
point. You will think me superstitious—some superstition I have in my 
blood, and always had; nevertheless, this is true—true at least it is 
that I heard what I now relate. 

“As I exclaimed ‘Jane! Jane! Jane!’ a voice—I cannot tell whence 
the voice came, but I know whose voice it was, replied, ‘I am coming: 
wait for me;’ and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the 
words, ‘Where are you?’ 

“Pll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my 
mind; yet it is difficult to express what I want to express, Ferndean is 
buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull and dies un- 
reverberating, ‘Where are you?’ seemed spoken amongst mountains; 
for I heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words. Cooler and fresher at the 
moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in 
some wild, lone scene I and Jane were meeting. In spirit, I believe we 
must have met. You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, 
Jane: perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for 
those were your accents—as certain as I live, they were yours!” 

Reader, it was on Monday night--near midnight—that I too, had re- 
ceived the mysterious summons: those were the words by which I re- 
plied to it. I listened to Mr. Rochester’s narrative, but made no dis- 
closure in return. The coincidence struck me as too awful and inex- 
plicable to be communicated or discussed. If I told anything, my tale 
would be such as must necessarily make a profound impression on the 
mind of my hearer; and that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to 
gloom, needed not the deeper shade of the supernatural. I kept these 
things then, and pondered them in my heart. 

“You cannot now wonder,” continued my master, “that when you 
rose upon me so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing 
you any other than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt 
to silence and annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo 
had melted before, Now, I thank God! I know it to be otherwise. Yes, 
I thank God!” 

He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his 
hrow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute devo- 
tion. Only the last words of the worship were audible:— 

“] thank my Maker that, in the midst of judgment, He has remem- 


388 JANE EYRE 


bered mercy. I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to 
leact henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!” 

Then he stretched his hand out to be led. I took that dear hand, 
held it a moment to my lips, then Jet it pass round my shoulder: being 
so much lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide, 
We entered the wood, and wended homeward. 


CHAPTER XXXVITI—conciusion 


Reaper, I married him, A quiet wedding we had: he and J, the parson 
and clerk, were alone present. When we got back frum church, I went 
into the kilchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the din- 
ner and John cleaning the knives, and I said,— 

“Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning.” The 
housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order 
of people to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remark- 
able piece of news without incurring the danger of having one’s ears 
pierced by some shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a tor- 
rent of wordy wonderment, Mary did look up, and she did stare at me; 
the ladfe with which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the 
fire, dic for some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same 
space of time John’s knives also had rest from the polishing process. 
But Mary, bending again over the roast, said only, 

“Fave you, miss? Well, for sure!” 

A short time after she pursued—"TI seed you go out with the master, 
but I didn’t know you were gone to church to be wed;” and she 
basted away, John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to 
ear. 

“T telled Mary how il would be,” he said: “I knew what Mr. Edward” 
(John was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the 
cadet of the house, therefore he often gave him his Christian name)—"I 
knew what Mr, Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait 
long neither: and he’s done right, for aught I know. I wish you joy, 
miss!” and he politely pulled his forelock. 

“Thank you, John, Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary 
this.” I put into his hand a five-pound note. Without waiting lo hear 
more, I left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time 
after I caught the words— 

“She'll happen to do better for him nor ony o’ t’ grand ladies.” And 
again, “If she ben’t one o’ th’ handsomest, she’s noan faal and varry 
good-natured ; and i’ his een she’s fair beautiful, onybody may see 
that,’ 


JANE EYRE 3890 


T wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what 
I had done—fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and 
Mary approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she would 
just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come 
and sec me. 

“She had better not wait till then, Jane,” said Mr. Rochester, when I 
read her letter to him; “if she does, she will be too late, for our honey- 
moon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your grave 
or mine.” 

How St, John received the news I don’t know: he never answered the 
letter in which I communicated it; yet six months after he wrote to me, 
without, however, mentioning Mr, Rochester’s name or alluding to my 
marriage. His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind. He 
has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever 
since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live 
without God in the world, and only mind earthly things. 

You have not quite forgotten little Adéle, have you, reader? I had 
not. I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester to go and see 
her at the school where he had placed her. Her frantic joy at beholding 
me again moved me much, She looked pale and thin; she said she was 
not happy. I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its 
course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with 
me. I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this 
impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another—my 
husband needed them all. So I sought out a school conducted on a more 
indulgent system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, 
and bringing her home sometimes. I took care she should never want 
for anything that could contribute to her comfort. She soon settled in 
her new abode, became very happy there, and made fair progress in her 
studies, As she grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great 
measure her French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a 
pleasing and obliging campanion—docile, good-tempered, and well- 
principled. By her grateful attention to me and mine, she has long 
since well repaid any little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer 
her. 

My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of 
married life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names 
have most frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done, 

I have now been married ten years. I know what it is to live en- 
tirely for and with what I love best on earth. I hold myself supremely 
blest—blest beyond what language can express, because I am my hus- 
band’s life as fully as he is mine. No woman was ever nearer to her 
mate than I am—ever more absolutely bone of his bone, and flesh of his 


399 JANE EYRE 


flesh. 1 know no weariness of my Edward’s society—he knows none of 
mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats 
in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together. To be to- 
gether is for us to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in com- 
pany. We talk, T believe, all day long: to talk to cach other is but a 
moore animated and an audible thinking, AH my confidence is bestowed 
on him, all his confidence is devoted Lo me; we are precisely suited in 
character—perfect concord is the result, 

Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union: per- 
haps it was that circumstance thal drew us so very near—that knit us 
so very close; for 1 was then his vision, as { am still his right hand. 
Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye. He saw 
nature, he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for 
his behalf, and of putting into words the effect of ficld, Lree, town, river, 
cloud, sunbeam—of the landscape before us; of the weather round us— 
and impressing by sound on his car what light could no longer stamp 
on his eye, Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of 
conducting him where he wished to go—of doing for him what he 
wished to be done. And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, 
most exquisile, even though sad—~because he claimed these services 
without painful shame or damping humiliation, [fe loved me so truly, 
that he knew no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he [elt I 
loved him so fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my 
sweetest wishes, 

One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to 
his dictation, he came and bent over me and said,-— 

“Jane, have you a glittering ornament round your neck?” 

Thad a gold watch-chain, I answered, “Yes.” 

“And have you a pale blue dress on?” 

had. fle informed me then that for some time he had fancied the 
obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense, and that now he 
was sure of it. 

He and fT went up to London. He had the advice of an eminent 
oculist, and he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye. [He can- 
not now see very distinctly; he cannot read or write much, but he can 
find his way without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank 
to him—the carth no Jonger a void. When his first-born was put into 
his arms, he could sce that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they 
once were—large, brilliant, and black. On that occasion, he again, with 
a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with 
mercy. 

My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those 
we most love are happy likewise. Diana and Mary Rivers are both mar+

ried: alternately, once every ycar, they come to see us, and we go to see 
them, Diana’s husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a 
good man, Mary’s is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother’s, and, 
from his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection. Both 
Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by 
them. 

As to St. John Rivers, he left England—he went to India. He en- 
tered on the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still. A more 
resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dan- 
gers. Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he 
labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he 
hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber 
it. He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet. 
But his is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pil- 
grim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon. His is the exaction of the 
apostle, who speaks but for Christ when he says—‘“Whosoever will 
come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow 
me.” His is the ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill 
a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth— 
who stand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last 
mighty victories of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful. 

St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now. Himself has hith- 
erto sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close—his glorious 
sun hastens to its setting. The last letter I received from him drew from 
my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anti- 
cipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown. I know that a strang- 
er’s hand will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant 
has been called at length into the joy of his Lord. And why weep for 
this? No fear of death will darken St. John’s last hour: his mind will 
be unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith 
steadfast. His own words are a pledge of this— 

“My Master,” he says, “has forewarned me. Daily He announces 
more distinctly, ‘Surely I come quickly!’ and hourly I more eagerly 
respond, ‘Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!’” -
