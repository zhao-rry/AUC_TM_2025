Oh, it's so easy
When parts take over
My conversation
Is nothing more than lies

You're just the viewer
So cold and distant
I've no intentions
Of saying "I love you"
My conversation
My conversation
My conversation
My conversation

And we are not gods
And we are not men
And we are not making claims
We are only boys

And you are not strong
And you are not force
And you are not regular
You are just wrong

There are no faces
This is my complex
You are my picture
I call you "mirrors"

These are not my tears
Not my reflection
Am I a photo?
I can't remember
My conversation
My conversation
My conversation
My conversation
My conversation
My conversation
My conversation
My conversation
My conversation
My conversation
My conversation
