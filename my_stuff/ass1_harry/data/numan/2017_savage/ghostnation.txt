[Verse]
We live in a windswept hell
Where dust and death are neighbours
We hide in a perfect storm
Not even God remembers

[Verse]
We ran from the wars of man
From everything you are and would be
We are invisible
We are the dead Ghost Nation

[Chorus]
When the sky came down
When the sun went dark
When the night was torn
And we heard God laugh
When The Righteous came
And they cleansed our sins
Have you ever seen death
With your own eyes?

[Verse]
We live in The Great Unfound
Where thought and ghost still wander
We drift on drifting sand
Where horrors of our past still linger

[Verse]
We hide from the world of man
From the cruelty that defines you
We are the wind that cries
We are the dead Ghost Nation

[Chorus]
When the sky came down
When the sun went dark
When the night was torn
And we heard God laugh
When the Righteous came
And they cleansed our sins
Have you ever seen God
With your own eyes?

[Bridge]
We are embers in the the flame
We are whispers in God's name
We're the heat that burns your skin
We’re the cold that lets pain in
We’re the wind that blinds your eyes
We’re the shame that haunts your lies
We’re the nightmare when you sleep
We’re the guilt that all men keep

[Chorus]
When the sky came down
When the sun went dark
When the night was torn
And we heard God laugh
When the Righteous came
And they cleansed our sins
Have you ever seen me
With your own eyes?
