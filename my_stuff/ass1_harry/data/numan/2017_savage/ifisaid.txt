If I said I was a painter would you love and comfort me?
If I said I was a soldier would you cry a tear for me?
If I said I was a poet would you share your hopes with me?
If I said I was a dreamer would you share your life with me?
If I asked you for forgiveness would you smile and wonder why?
Would you say that you believed me or would it all fall down?
Would it all fall down?
Is it over; is it over now?
If I said I was a liar would you lose your faith in me?
If I said I was mistaken would you share the blame with me?
If I said I was a memory would you still remember me?
If I said I was a warning would you shy away from me?
If I asked you for forgiveness would you turn your face away?
Would you say I broke your heart and would it all fall down?
Would it all fall down?
Is it over; is it over now?
When a new tear falls
When I hear you cry softly
I would give the world to change the past
And when you walked away
And I saw what I was losing
Only me to blame, I wondered why, why, why
So it all comes back to haunt me
Like a song that sings your name
And it burns here to remind me
That it all comes back as pain
When I asked you for forgiveness and the words drifted away
I watched them float in empty silence as it all fell down
As it all fell down
It was over
It was over... then
