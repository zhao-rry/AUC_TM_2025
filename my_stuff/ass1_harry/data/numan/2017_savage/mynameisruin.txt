When they called me broken, I knew
When they called me evil, I knew
When they called me Ruin, I knew
I would always find my way to you

When I begged forgiveness, they knew
When I begged for mercy, they knew
When I begged for nothing, they knew
I would always find my way to you

My name is Ruin, my name is vengeance
My name is no-one, no-one is calling
My name is Ruin, my name is heartbreak
My name is lonely, my sorrow's a darkness
My name is Ruin, my name is evil
My name's a war song, I sing you a new one
My name is ruin, my name is broken
My name is shameless, I'll tear your world open

When I called you poison, you knew
When I called you shameful, you knew
When I called you a liar, you knew
I would always find my way to you

I'll show you ruin, I'll show you vengeance
I'll show you no one, and no one is calling
I'll show you ruin, I'll show you heartbreak
I'll show you loving, and sorrow and darkness
I'll show you ruin, I'll show you evil
I'll sing you a war song, I'll sing you a new one
I'll show you ruin, I'll show you broken
I'll show you shameless, I'll tear your world open
