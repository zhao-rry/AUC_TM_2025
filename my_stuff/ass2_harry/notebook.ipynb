    "## Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "> Remember that this is a code notebook - add an explanation of what you do using text boxes and markdown, and comment your code. Answers without explanations may get less points.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If you re-use a substantial portion of code you find online, e.g on Stackoverflow, you need to add a link to it and make the borrowing explicit. The same applies of you take it and modify it, even substantially. There is nothing bad in doing that, providing you are acknowledging it and make it clear you know what you're doing.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The **Generative AI policy** from the syllabus for the programming assignments applies. Generative AI can be used as a source of information in these assignments if properly referenced. You can use generative AI assistance for writing code, but you must reference the chat used as a source, just as if you would take from StackOverflow. In ChatGPT, you can make an URL to the information you obtained by clicking the \"Share link to Chat\" button and then \"Copy Link\". This allows you to cite the source of the information you use in your answer or code solution. Of course, as you know, GenAI tools are not always a reliable source and its answers are intransparantly drawn from other sources - it is recommended to cross-check its output with other sources or your own understanding of the topic.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> For the explanations of what you do that you provide with each question, as well as for (sub)questions that ask about things like motivation of choices or your opinion, the answer to this must be conceptualized and written by yourself and not copied from a generative AI source.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Make sure your notebooks have been run when you submit, as I won't run them myself. Submit both the `.ipynb` file along with an `.html` export of the same. Submit all necessary auxilliary files as well. Please compress your submission into a `.zip` archive. Only `.zip` files can be submitted.\n",
    "> If you are using Google Colab, here is a tutorial for obtaining an HTML export: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53460051/convert-ipynb-notebook-to-html-in-google-colab .\n",
    ">\n",
    "> With Jupyter, you can simply export it as HTML through the File menu."

    "## Grading policy\n",
    "> As follows:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * 70 points for correctly completing the assignment.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * 20 points for appropriately writing and organizing your code in terms of structure, readibility (also by humans), comments and minimal documentation. It is important to be concise but also to explain what you did and why, when not obvious. Feel free to re-use functions and variables from previous questions if that helps for structure and readability - you do not need to repeat previous steps for each question.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * 10 points for doing something extra, e.g., if you go beyond expectations (overall or on something specific). Some ideas for extras might be mentioned in the exercises, or you can come up with your own. You don't need to do them all to get the bonus. The sum of points is 90, doing (some of) the extras can bring you to 100, so the extras are not necessary to get an A.\n",
