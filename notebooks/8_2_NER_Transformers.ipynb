    "\n",
    "*This notebook is largely copied from a tutorial from Niels Rogge's series of Transformers model tutorials: https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/blob/master/BERT/Custom_Named_Entity_Recognition_with_BERT.ipynb - If you want to learn about other types of transformer models, also for images and such, do [check out the series here](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials)!*\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals of this lab:\n",
    "* Learn how to tune a BERT-based model for a downstream task using the Transformers library\n",
    "* Learn how to perform token classification for Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n",
    "* Learn which hyper-parameters are important when training on a multi-classification problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to use **DistilBertForTokenClassification** which is included in the [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) by HuggingFace. This model has DistilBERT as its base architecture, with a token classification head on top, allowing it to make predictions at the token level, rather than the sequence level. Named entity recognition is typically treated as a token classification problem, so that's what we are going to use it for. We use DistilBERT rather than BERT because it is smaller and easier to tune on a regular laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the idea of **transfer learning**, i.e. first pretraining a large neural network in an unsupervised way, and then fine-tuning that neural network on a task of interest. In this case, BERT is a neural network pretrained on 2 tasks: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. Now, we are going to fine-tune this network on a NER dataset. Fine-tuning is supervised learning, so this means we will need a labeled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know more about BERT, I suggest the following resources:\n",
    "* the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)\n",
    "* Jay Allamar's [blog post](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/) as well as his [tutorial](http://jalammar.github.io/a-visual-guide-to-using-bert-for-the-first-time/)\n",
    "* Chris Mccormick's [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoRX98PLOsaN8PtekB9kWrw)\n",

    "#### **Downloading and preprocessing the data**\n",
    "Named entity recognition (NER) uses a specific annotation scheme, which is defined (at least for European languages) at the *word* level. An annotation scheme that is widely used is called **[IOB-tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside%E2%80%93outside%E2%80%93beginning_(tagging)**, which stands for Inside-Outside-Beginning. Each tag indicates whether the corresponding word is *inside*, *outside* or at the *beginning* of a specific named entity. The reason this is used is because named entities usually comprise more than 1 word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at an example. If you have a sentence like \"Barack Obama was born in HawaÃ¯\", then the corresponding tags would be   [B-PERS, I-PERS, O, O, O, B-GEO]. B-PERS means that the word \"Barack\" is the beginning of a person, I-PERS means that the word \"Obama\" is inside a person, \"O\" means that the word \"was\" is outside a named entity, and so on. So one typically has as many tags as there are words in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you want to train a deep learning model for NER, it requires that you have your data in this IOB format (or similar formats such as [BILOU](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17116446/what-do-the-bilou-tags-mean-in-named-entity-recognition)). There exist many annotation tools which let you create these kind of annotations automatically (such as Spacy's [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/), [Tagtog](https://docs.tagtog.net/) or [Doccano](https://github.com/doccano/doccano)). You can also use Spacy's [biluo_tags_from_offsets](https://spacy.io/api/goldparse#biluo_tags_from_offsets) function to convert annotations at the character level to IOB format.\n",

    "A tricky part of NER with BERT is that BERT relies on **wordpiece tokenization**, rather than word tokenization. This means that we should also define the labels at the wordpiece-level, rather than the word-level!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have word like \"Washington\" which is labeled as \"b-gpe\", but it gets tokenized to \"Wash\", \"##ing\", \"##ton\", then one approach could be to handle this by only train the model on the tag labels for the first word piece token of a word (i.e. only label \"Wash\" with \"b-gpe\"). This is what was done in the original BERT paper, see Github discussion [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/64#issuecomment-443703063).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is a **design decision**. You could also decide to propagate the original label of the word to all of its word pieces and let the model train on this. In that case, the model should be able to produce the correct labels for each individual wordpiece. This was done in [this NER tutorial with BERT](https://github.com/chambliss/Multilingual_NER/blob/master/python/utils/main_utils.py#L118). Another design decision could be to give the first wordpiece of each word the original word label, and then use the label âXâ for all subsequent subwords of that word. All of them seem to lead to good performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we define a regular PyTorch [dataset class](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) (which transforms examples of a dataframe to PyTorch tensors). Here, each sentence gets tokenized, the special tokens that BERT expects are added, the tokens are padded or truncated based on the max length of the model, the attention mask is created and the labels are created based on the dictionary which we defined above. Word pieces that should be ignored have a label of -100 (which is the default `ignore_index` of PyTorch's [CrossEntropyLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html)).\n",

The initial loss of your model should be close to -ln(1/number of classes) = -ln(1/9) = 2.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because we are using cross entropy loss. The cross entropy loss is defined as -ln(probability score of the model for the correct class). In the beginning, the weights are random, so the probability distribution for all of the classes for a given token will be uniform, meaning that the probability for the correct class will be near 1/9. The loss for a given token will thus be -ln(1/9). As PyTorch's [CrossEntropyLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html) (which is used by `BertForTokenClassification`) uses *mean reduction* by default, it will compute the mean loss for each of the tokens in the sequence for which a label is provided.\n",

    "As you can see from our original F1 score charts, both models have peaks that occur before the end of the training. However, as we continue training, we overwrite the parameters and weights that produced these \"best\" results. In real scenarios, we must store them somewhere and at the end of the training, resume the model state to the one that produced best results.\n",

    "Create another `train()` function and modify it in a way that when validating, you make sure to save the model if a new best result is found. The Transformers library also provides this functionality.\n",

    "## Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The BERT models accept many hyper-parameters, also when tuning. The code above specifies some (but not all) under **Preparing the dataset and dataloader**, but we may obtain better results by changing them. Try to play with them, read what they do in the Transformers documentation for the respective model and report your findings. Are any of those parameters more important than the rest or lead to much better or worse performance?\n",

    "## Other models\n",
    "\n",
    "We've used DistilBERT, which is very efficient but perhaps not the best-performing model. Let's be more ambitious now and perform the same task with [ModernBERT](https://huggingface.co/blog/modernbert) (a recent model) or [XLNet](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/xlnet) (generally performs well at token classification tasks like NER). The Transformers library should allow you to do this with minimal code changes."
